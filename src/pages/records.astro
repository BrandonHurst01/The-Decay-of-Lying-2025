Where, if not from the Impressionists,</span><note rend="small"></note><br><span class="addition"> do we get those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping</span><br><span class="addition"> down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and changing</span><br><span class="addition"> the houses into monstrous shadows?

The </span><br><span class="addition">extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate</span><br><span class="addition"> of London during the last ten years is entirely due to</span><br><span class="addition"> this particular school of Art. You smile. Consider the </span><br><span class="addition">matter from a scientific or a metaphysical point of view,</span><br><span class="addition"> and you will find that I am right. For what is Nature?</span><br><span class="addition"> Nature is no great mother who has borne us. She is our </span><br><span class="addition">creation. It is in our brain that she quickens to life.</span><br><span class="addition"> Things are because we see them, and what we see, and</span><br><span class="addition"> how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced</span><br><span class="addition"> us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a</span><br><span class="addition"> thing. One does not see anything until one sees its</span><br><span class="addition"> beauty. Then, and then only, does it come into existence.</span><br><span class="addition"> At present, people see fogs, not because there</span><br><milestone n="intentions_35"></milestone><span class="addition"> are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught </span><br><span class="addition">them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There</span><br><span class="addition"> may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say </span><br><span class="addition">there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not</span><br><span class="addition"> know anything about them. They did not exist until</span><br><span class="addition"> Art had invented them. Now, it must be admitted, fogs</span><br><span class="addition"> are carried to excess. They have become the mere</span><br><span class="addition"> mannerism of a clique, and the exaggerated realism of</span><br><span class="addition"> their method gives dull people bronchitis. Where the</span><br><span class="addition"> cultured catch an effect, the uncultured catch cold.</span><br><span class="addition"> And so, let us be humane, and invite Art to turn her</span><br><span class="addition"> wonderful eyes elsewhere. She has done so already,</span><br><span class="addition"> indeed. That white quivering sunlight that one sees</span><br><span class="addition"> now in France, with its strange blotches of mauve, and </span><br><span class="addition">its restless violet shadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the</span><br><span class="addition"> whole, Nature produces it quite admirably. Where she</span><br><span class="addition"> used to give us Corots and Daubignys,</span><note rend="small">112</note><span class="addition"> she gives us now </span><br><span class="addition">exquisite Monets and entrancing Pisaros.</span><note rend="small">113</note><span class="addition"> Indeed there</span><br><span class="addition"> are moments, rare, it is true, but still to be observed from</span><br><span class="addition"> time to time, when Nature becomes absolutely modern. </span><br><span class="addition">Of course she is not always to be relied upon. The fact </span><br><span class="addition">is that she is in this unfortunate position. Art creates</span><br><span class="addition"> an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so,</span><br><span class="addition"> passes on to other things. Nature, upon the other hand, </span><br><span class="addition">forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form</span><br><span class="addition"> of insult, keeps on repeating this effect until we all </span><br><span class="addition">become absolutely wearied of it. Nobody of any real </span><br><span class="addition">culture, for instance, ever talks now</span><span class="addition">-</span><span class="addition">a</span><span class="addition">-</span><span class="addition">days about the</span><br><span class="addition"> beauty of the sunset. Sunsets are quite old-fashioned.</span><note rend="small">114</note><br><span class="addition"> They belong to the time when Turner was the last note</span><br><span class="addition"> in Art.</span><note rend="small">115</note> <span class="addition">To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism</span><milestone n="intentions_51"></milestone><span class="addition"> <br>of temperament.

It was simply a very</span><br><span class="addition"> second-rate Turner, a Turner of a bad period, with all</span><br><span class="addition"> the painter's worst faults exaggerated and over-emphasized.</span><br><span class="addition"> Of course, I am quite ready to admit that Life</span><br><span class="addition"> very often commits the same error. She produces her</span><br><span class="addition"> false Renés and her sham Vautrins, just as Nature gives</span><br><span class="addition"> us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp, and on another a more</span><br><span class="addition"> than questionable Rousseau.</span><note rend="small">116</note><span class="addition"> Still, Nature irritates one</span><br><span class="addition"> more when she does things of that kind.

As a method Realism<br> is a complete failure, and the two<br> things that every artist should avoid<br> are modernity of form and modernity <br>of subject<span class="addition">-</span>matter. To us, who live in<br> the nineteenth century, any century is<br> a suitable subject for art except<br> our own. The only beautiful things are<br> the things that do not concern us.

            <p>1.Cyril and Vivian were the names of Wilde's two sons. Nottinghamshire is a county
               in the English Midlands. Guy suggests that Wilde "may have had a specific country
               house in mind - the rectory in Bingham (in the east of the county) the incumbent of
               which was the Revd Robert Miles (1819-83), the father of one of Wilde's artist-friends,
               Frank Miles (1852-91)." Schroeder disagrees, offering instead the possibility of the
               "Clumber House (rebuilt 1879, demolished 1938) near Worksop, the seat of the seventh
               Duke of Newcastle, Henry Pelham-Clinton (1864-1928), where Wilde stayed in Nov. 1886
               and Oct. 1888." (Guy 360, Schroeder 22).

            <p>2.Jean Baptiste Corot, the French landscape painter, frequently alluded to and praised
               in Wilde's writing. In his review titled "The New President," composed concurrently
               to the earliest drafts of "The Decay of Lying" Wilde alludes to Corot in his critique
               of Wyke Bayliss, President of the Royal Society of Arts: "What is the use of telling
               artists that they should try and paint Nature as she really is? What nature really
               is, is a question for metaphysics, not for art. Art deals with appearances, and the
               eye of the man who looks at Nature, the vision in fact of the artist, is far more
               imporant to us than what he looks at. There is more truth in Corot's aphorism, that
               a landscape is simply the 'mood of a man's mind,' than theire is in al Mr. Bayliss's
               laborious disquisitions on naturalism" (PMG, Jan. 26, 1889).

            <p>4.Schroeder identifies Politics, I.iii.18 as Wilde's reference. As Guy and Bristow

               assertion that "it will never match the infinite variety and subtlety of nature; no
               drawing or painting will equal the primary beauties of the living model' (The Model',

               rush-bottomed 'Sussex' chairs" sold by Morris &amp; Co., "a firm established by poet,
               painter, and designer William Morris" (362).

            <p>9. Guy suggests that this may be a reference to the ongoing discourse on education
               reforms taking place in the Nineteenth Century. See also Guy, “Self-Plagiarism, Creativity
               and Craftsmanship in Oscar Wilde.” English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920, no.

            </p>
            				
            <p>11. A reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance." In the essay, Emerson writes
               that the two "terrors" of self-reliance are conformity and consistency. He writes:
               "The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for
               our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing
               our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. . . A foolish consistency
               is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and
               divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern
               himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow
               speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing
               you said to-day.&mdash;'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.'&mdash;Is it so bad, then,
               to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther,
               and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever
               took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood." Guy notes that Wilde frequently referenced
               Emerson throughout his career, and even requested a volume of his essays while in
               prison.

            <p>13. Schroeder suggests this is a reformulation of Byron's Don Juan, Canto XI, stanza
               37: "And, after all, what is a lie? 'Tis but /The truth in masquerade."

            <p>15. The revival Vivian refers to is an invention. As Josephine Guy notes, "the original
               Retrospective Review, founded in 180 and runnign until 1828, dealt with historical
               and antiquarian subjects; a second Retrospective Review—which (according to Evans)
               consisted of criticism of, and extracts from, curious and rare books­—was briefly
               published in 1853-4 (Evans 295)" (Guy 364).

            <p>19. In the cut directions, Cyril takes a characteristically decadent position, like

            <p>22. As Guy notes, Wilde presumably means the national library, the Bibliothèque Nationale,
               in Paris. 23. Schroeder argues that this passage was the basis for a passage in Max
               Beerbom's Parody of 1893 parody "Oscar Wilde." See Anglo-American Times, 25 March
               1893 and Schroeder 28.
            </p>
            				
            <p>24. Guy notes that this may have been an allusion to Whistler, who had previously
               accused Wilde of plagiarism and would later accuse him of plagiarizing "The Decay
               of Lying" from his Lectures. This prompted a series of additions to the Intentions
               edition of "The Decay of Lying" directed at Whilster.
            </p>
            				
            <p>25. Possible allusion to Zola's L'Assomoir</p>
            				
            <p>26. Reference to The Republic, Book 10, 595 ff. (Guy 366). One can trace the connection
               between lying and poetry to "poiesis," derived from the Greek "ποιεῖν" or "to make."
               I.e., both are acts of creating something wholly new, which Wilde continues to position
               in opposition to realism or naturalism's mimetic attempts at REpresentation. See also
               the addition to Folio 53.

            <p>27 Serialized in 1883. Published as a book in 1888. As Guy notes, Wilde wrote to Ross
               from Reading Gaol, "complaining about the state of the prison library and suggesting
               that he might present the authorities with 'a dozen good novels', including 'Stevenson
               (none here but the Black Arrow!)'" (Guy 367, quoting H &amp; H-D, 646, 790).
            </p>
            				
            <p>28. Both Guy and Schroeder suggest that Wilde was likely interested in the (accurate)
               accusations of plagiarism levied at Haggard in the Pall Mall Gazette. Guy and Schroeder
               both identify Haggard's Allan Quartermain novels as alluded to works containing footnotes.
               While Guy notes that “pseudo-footnotes by the narrator purporting to authenticate”
               details about the African setting, containing "information. . .derived from Haggard's
               own inexperience of Africa," suggests the jab at their inclusion is a straightforward
               mocking of Haggard’s rhetorical technique. On the other hand, Schroeder, claims that
               there is “mock-seriousness [to] Haggard's footnotes which Wilde must have enjoyed
               and which he is here criticizing tongue-in-cheek” (Schroeder 29).
            </p>
            				
            <p>29. Journalist, biographer, and friend of "one of Wilde's favourite poets, Dante Gabriel
               Rossetti," Wilde was (reportedly) critical of his Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti
               immediately following the poets death, and scathingly critiqued his biography of Samuel
               Taylor Coleridge in a review (Guy 367).
            </p>
            				
            <p>30. James Payn, prolific mid-nineteenth century journalist, poet, essayist, and novelist.</p>
            				
            <p>31. Scottish writer of what, as Guy explains, was "disparagingly referred to as the
               Kailyard (or cabbage-patch) School" (368). Also a pun on the myth of Phaeton.
            </p>
            				
            <p>32. Per the Clarck Art Museum: "Chromolithography is a term used for color lithographs
               characterized by saturated, high-gloss color, usually covering the entire sheet. Although
               color lithography and chromolithography are made by the same technique, their visual
               results—and uses—contrast greatly. Chromolithographs, known familiarly as “chromos,”
               were typically associated with popular art and decorative materials: trade cards,
               children’s books, and reproductive prints of paintings. As mass-produced products,
               chromolithographs were printed widely to meet consumer demand. While this made artistic
               images available—and affordable—to many, these works were perceived without the aura
               of exclusivity or creativity of fine-art color lithographs." Wilde once used the term
               to disparaginly describe the methoeds of Scottish novelists (Reviews 163; Guy 368).
               The following passage about local colour" closely echoes his earlier critique of Scottish
               novelists, and may be yet another instance of his "Self-plagiarism," or adaptive revision
               of his other works, demonstrating a self-reflexive dimension to his "creative ecology"
               (Van Hulle). https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/hue-cry/chromolithography#:~:text=Chromolithography%20is%20a%20term%20used,%E2%80%94and%20uses%E2%80%94contrast%20greatly.
            </p>
            				
            <p>33. Scottish novelist Margaret Oliphant and Marion Crawford, who Guy notes, was "a popular and prolific ex-patriot American author and historian"
               (368).
            </p>
            				
            <p>34. Wilde's revised criticisms of the Mary Ward's novel occur both before and after
               his initial composition of the first version of Dorian Gray in 1890. As Andrew Elfenbein
               has persausively argued in "On the Discrimination of Influences” (MLQ, esp. 496-505),
               Wilde's novel simultaneously mocks and adopts certain textual features of teh extremely
               popular novel, illustrating the complex "influece" of reading on composition. Wilde's
               iterative passes at this part of the essay not only suggests a clear preoccupation
               with novel in fashion that materially substantiates Elfenbein's claims, but also,
               as an illustration of Van Hulle's notion of creative concurrence, materializes in
               a confluence of creative activity the social, dialectic nature of writing (and literary
               influence, as Elfenbein argues).
            </p>
            				
            <p>35. "A meat-tea was a more substantial meal taken later in the day, and is used by
               W to indicate the indicate the eating habits of the lower classes or of those who
               disregarded, or were ignorant of, the rules of etiquette which governed polite society.
               . .Nonconformist was a broad term in the 19th century to refer to a variety of Protestant
               sects which defined themselves in opposition to the teachings of the Anglican or established
               church; in Culture and Anarchy (1869) Matthew Arnold identified nonconformism with
               provincialism and vulgarity, and criticized its partisan tendencies as culturally
               divisive.” (Guy 368).
            </p>
            				
            <p>36. This passage underwent revisions in each iteration of the essay. Wilde first expanded
               the Berg version, introducing the "friend" framework, when drafting this fair-copy
               version. Then, when restoring the omitted passage for Intentions, he changed the language
               to include Cyril: "mine" was changed to "ours" and me to "us". The friend’s enjoyment
               of the story, and any "praise" given to it, were also removed. "he liked it because"
               was excised and already revised "praise we can give to it" ("thing that can be said
               to its favour" upon initial inscription") was changed to "and we can quite believe
               it." The passage was relocated to before "Indeed" and the sentence "England is the
               home of lost ideas" was added after the "produced" (altered from "possible")
            </p>
            				
            <p>37. See also Wilde’s references to the East-End in Dorian Gray, A Woman of No Importance,
               The Soul of Man, and his review of Dorinda.
            </p>
            				
            <p>38. A French author of short stories and novels of the naturalist school. Wilde praises
               his work and laments Maupassant’s death in letters dating from 1891 and 1899 (Guy
               370).
            </p>
            				
            <p>39. As Guy notes, Wilde’s is “a deliberate misquotation” from Le Roman expérimental.
               The original translates to “A man of genius is not spiritual, and a man of genius
               is needed to establish authoritatively the formula for naturalism,” while Wilde’s
               reads “a man of genius is never witty” (Guy 370, quoting Oeuvres complétes, x. 1245).
            </p>
            				
            <p>40. Wilde expanded this from a shorter Berg variant, adding “from beginning to end”</p>
            				
            <p>41. Wilde changes the allusion from The Tempest to Molière’s Le Tartuffe, when revising
               for Intentions. Guy notes that “In De Profundis and a cancelled draft of A Woman of
               No Importance Wilde cites both characters as interchangeable,” yet this switch reinforces
               a national lens to this section of the essay, firmly aligning the critique with French
               literature. Moreover, while Caliban’s anger emerges out of self-reflection, Tartuffe
               is exposed by others. One is firmly grounded in an inward looking act, while the other
               external, perhaps echoing the dichotomy the essay crafts between a self-reflexive,
               creative “lying” and externally focused, mimetic (in someways, Wilde argues, more
               imitative and deceptive) realism.

            </p>
            				
            <p>44. Wilde cuts from the Berg variant the rest of the line, Daudet's Fromont jeune
               et Risler aîné “Je n'ai pas le droit de renoncer au théâtre.” As Schroeder notes,
               these are the actual lines the actor actually “keeps repeating” (32). Wilde keeps
               the lines translating to “it is necessary to struggle for art,” but removes the following
               line “I have no right to give it up.”
            </p>
            				
            <p>45. Throughout, Wilde continually revies “me” and “I” to “us” and “we,” both bringing
               in Cyril as concurring in this line of thinking, and perhaps also implicating the
               reader and a larger movements. Such revisions work to suggest that this is a part
               of a larger movement, not just Vivian’s lone opinion. The opening clause of the following
               sentence is taken from “Balzac in English.”

            </p>
            				
            <p>48. Wilde revised this passage multiple times. Lines were cut on the previous folio
               beginning a reflection on “the mere discussion of modern novels,” and Wilde reformulated
               the language concluding Vivian’s part here when inscribing the Akron MS and changed
               “say” to “insist,” a more firm assertion, in Intentions.

            <p>50. As Guy notes, “T.H. Green (1836-82), to whom Robert Elsmere is dedicated, was
               Professor of Moral Philosophy of Oxford from 1878; an idealist philosopher of neo-Kantian
               school, he exercised a considerable influence on late 19th-century philosophy in England.
               He appears in Robert Elsmere as the sympathetic Henry Grey, an Oxford don who has
               forged a workable, if idiosyncratic compromise between his Chrisitan faith, rational
               scepticism, and social activism” (373)

            <p>53. Wilde here substitutes “method” for “style.” For the aesthetics, following Pater’s
               essay “style,” the term held a particular definition as what might be said to be the
               purest form of self-expression, and thus the most universal, in literature. “The style,
               the manner, would be the man, not in his unreasoned and really uncharacteristic caprices,
               involuntary or affected, but in absolutely sincere apprehension of what is most real
               to him. . . If the style be the man, in all the colour and intensity of a veritable
               apprehension, it will be in a real sense ‘impersonal’” (36-37). It is “style,” the
               attempt to reach pure subjectivity outside of cultural constructs that color our impressions
               of art and the world, that separated the Romantics from the Realists, and, indeed,
               is the pitfall of Realism that Wilde argues in this essay. In the Berg, he struck
               Cyril’s rebuttal, “His want of style, you mean” and Vivian’s immediate rebuttal. The
               following claim that Meredith is “at a heart, a true Romanticist” is integrated further
               below. Schroeder notes that Wilde here uses “A proverbial expression, derived from
               1 Kings 19.18: 'Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have
               not bowed unto Baal.’” (36)
            </p>
            				
            <p>54. As Guy notes, this and the following passages resembles Wilde’s 1886 review of
               Balzac. The translated quote from French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire, is slightly
               altered from his essay on “Theophile Gautier” (Guy 375). “Fiery-coloured” is a descriptive
               phrase that appears in a number of his writings.

            <p>56. All references to novels by Gustave Flaubert</p>
            				
            <p>57. The deletion of the reference to Schopenhauer may have been a correction, Both
               Schroeder and Guy identify this is as an allusion to Theophile Gautier. More presciely,
               his preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin: “Nothing is really beautiful until it is useless;
               everything useful is ugly, for it expresses a need, and the needs of man are ignoble
               and idsgustiing, like his poor and weak nature” (Guy 367). This philosophical foundation
               of this idea comes from Kant’s Critique of Judgement, where a true aesthetic judgement
               of the beautiful can only be made when an object pleases us in its purposelessness.
               We have no interest in the object, and we are not “pleased” or “satisfied” with its
               ability to perform a task or service. We must take pleasure in the object in itself.
               Nonetheless, the reference to the Pessimist philosopher Arhtur Schopenhauer (who was
               Kantian in his aesthetics and much of his philosophy), complicates the allusion and
               its meaning within the context of the essay.
            </p>
            				
            <p>58. As Guy notes, “most commentators viewed Reade’s Griffith Gaunt (1866) as his best
               work. In 1884 Swinburn published a detailed appreciation of Reade’s career in the
               NC. In his article, he favorably compared Reade’s novel – as Wilde goes on to do –
               with George Eliot’s Romola” (377). The privileging of Romola over Daniel Deronda may
               stem from its setting: 15th Century Italy versus contemporary Victorian society.
            </p>
            				
            <p>59. Wilde uses the same phrase in his December 1888 article “A Note on Some Modern
               Poets” and in his column “The Poets’ Corner’” in the April 6, 1888 issue of the Pall
               Mall Gazette

            <p>60. This partial quote from Troilus and Cressida was added in the 1891 publication,
               but appears in Variants elsewhere. As Guy reports, it was included in “an unpublished
               manuscript dating from the 1880s. . .comprising draft aphorisms and epigrams (some
               of which were revised for ‘Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young). . .It
               is impossible to know whether this aphorism was inspired Whistler’s lecture (first
               delivered and reviewed by Wilde in 1885), or whether it had come to Wilde independently’”
               (378). The allusion also appears, recontextualized and with new meaning, in An Ideal
               Husband.
            </p>
            				
            <p>The movement of this passage across a number of materials, its relationship to his
               reading and perhaps his attendance at a lecture, and the creative reappropriation
               and reimagining of the quote in new creative contexts makes apparent the fluidity
               and permeability of textual boundaries, as ideas and phrases move across different
               “texts” and take on new meanings in various material and temporal environments.
            </p>
            				
            <p>61. A nineteenth century commonplace to consider Wordsworth’s poetry as varying drastically
               in its merits, largely ushered in by the Second Wave Romantics criticisms of Wordsworth’s
               later poetry (particularly The Excursion), a poetic fall in quality they tied with
               his notorious conservative turn.
            </p>
            				
            <p>62. From Wordsworth’s “The Tables Turned”</p>
            				
            <p>63. Wilde’s addition of the following clause and sentence complicates the previous
               notion about the poet’s subjectivity and reception of aesthetic experience. Cyril’s
               claim that “the return to Nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great
               personality” could be construed in two ways. Either, it may constitute an identification
               with a Pantheistic Oversoul that permeates all “persons”—drawing upon Emerson and
               earlier Romantic contentions of nature. Or, it may be a view of Nature as “abolishing”
               individuality—the erasure of individuality and subjective experience through the connection
               or “return to” an all-encompassing Absolute connection to “Nature,” creating a singular
               “objective” experience. These positions are not mutually exclusive, and indeed many
               scholars have read pantheism and Romantic conceptions of nature as an subsumption
               of individuality by the impersonal. Relatedly, Hilda Schiff’s influential reading
               of the essay argues that Wilde offers a conception of the artist-nature relationship
               in which, in deference to nature as the ideal, nature not only fails to “unite” with
               the individual, but “abolishes” the artist by “abstracting” the artist (“Nature and
               Art in Oscar Wilde’s ‘The Decay of Lying’ 87).

            <p>65. The omission of “re-writes history,” present in the Berg variant may be to avoid
               repetition with his assessment of the “Dramatic Arts” below.

            <p>66. British Decadence in the fin-de-siecle as a movement, of which Wilde was a literary
               figurehead, was deeply indebted to works by Edgar Allan Poe, Theophile Gautier, and
               Charles Baudelaier and epitomized by Joris-Karl Huysmans’s novel A Rebour, figures
               referenced here and throughout Wilde’s ouevere. The movement held, as its “basic principle,”
               the “complete opposition to Nature: hence its systematic cultivation of drugs, cosmetics,
               Catholic ritual, supposedly ‘unnatural’ sexual practices, and sterility and artificiality
               in all things.” Arthur Symons, “in his essay ‘The Decadent Movement in Literature’
               (1893), described the phenomenon as ‘an interesting disease’ typical of an over-luxurious
               civilization, characterized by ‘an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity
               in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral
               perversity’.” (Baldick, Chris. "decadence." The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms,
               Oxford University Press, 2015).

            <p>Hilda Schiff claims, in passages like this, that Wilde moves to position nature as
               “a starting-point” that “has challenged man to improve upon her imperfections” (88).
            </p>
            				
            <p>68. From “Nature and Art.” Quoted also by Pater and Matthew Arnold in their essays
               on Henri Frederic Amiel’s Journal intime. Wilde drafted an unpublished review for
               this work as well. The ideas expressed here by Goethe, the prominent figurehead of
               German Romanticism and a touchstone for many Romantic writers that followed, not only
               are similarly echoed by the Jena Romantics, but throughout the nineteenth century.
               Walter Pater, in his essay “Style” (which has oft been cited as the most apparent
               influence on Wilde’s essay and the aesthetic philosophy, and may have been directly
               referenced in Wilde’s capitalization of the term here the Akron MS) similarly writes:
            </p>
            				
            <p>“Here, then, with a view to the central need of a select few, those " men of a finer
               thread " who have formed and maintain the literary ideal, everything, every component
               element, will have undergone exact trial, and, above all, there will be no uncharacteristic
               or tarnished or vulgar decoration, permissible ornament being for the most part structural,
               or necessary. As the painter in his picture, so the artist in his book, aims at the
               production by honourable artifice of a peculiar atmosphere. " The artist," says Schiller,
               " may be known rather by what he omits" ; and in literature, too, the true artist
               may be best recognised by his tact of omission.” (emphasis added).
            </p>
            				
            <p>For, according to Pater, the removal of “surplage” allows for the artist to express
               what he calls the “mind in style”: “a more intimate quality of good style : more intimate,
               as coming nearer to the artist himself.” Such a style would be a pure mediation of
               subjective experience, unifying sign and signified in the act of expression: “All
               the laws of good writing aim at a similar unity or identity of the mind in all the
               processes by which the word is associated to its import. The term is right, and has
               its essential beauty, when it becomes, in a manner, what it signifies, as with the
               names of simple sensations. To give the phrase, the sentence, the structural member,
               the entire composition, song, or essay, a similar unity with its subject and with
               itself:—style is in the right way when it tends towards that.”
            </p>
            				
            <p>69. Josephine Guy suggests that Wilde “is almost certainly thinking of Henry Arthur
               Jones” who he “refereed to disparagingly in ‘The Critic as Artist’” (382). However,
               the MS evidences his reference here to Henry Pettitt and George Robert Sims, both
               prolific playwrights (Sims was also a poet, journalist, and novelist; Pettitt an actor).
               They were also collaborators on a significant number of works. At this point in time
               two of their most popular collaborative works, In the Ranks (1883) and Harbour Lights
               (1885), which had 457 and 513 performances respectively at London’s famous Adelphi
               Theatre, had been released. As Schroeder correctly infers, “Theatres noted for their
               productions of melodrama were the Princess's and, above all, the Adelphi which had
               become a byword for melodrama ('Adelphi melodrama'). Besides, the most representative
               authors of the genre were Henry Pettitt, Sydney Grundy and George Robert Sims” (39).
            </p>
            				
            <p>70. Wilde’s deletion here conflates between the novel as form with the “imitative
               form of literature,” or realism as a genre, suggesting a pervasiveness of the realist
               genre to the degree that it could be implied through mere reference to the novel.
            </p>
            				
            <p>71. Wilde’s cut reference to “Gobelins” corroborates Guy’s connection of this passage
               to his review of William Morris’s lecture, “Carpet and Tapestry Weaving.” Wilde not
               only paraphrases, but pulls language directly from the review, again reimagining,
               and imbuing with new meaning (and perhaps enacting his own theory of layering art
               upon art), his previous prose within the new context of the essay. It is not merely
               a “restatement in different terms, of many ideas first broached in the earlier Reviews,”
               as R.J. Green argues, but creative, adaptive revision of his previous writing for
               an entirely creative act (398). https://link-gale-com.ezproxy.lib.uconn.edu/apps/doc/BA3200413854/BNCN?u=22516&amp;sid=bookmark-BNCN&amp;pg=6&amp;xid=10ba7768
            </p>
            				
            <p>72. While the term “originally. . .designated the Isrealites,” Matthew Arnold popularized
               the term in British literary and cultural criticism in his essay “Heine” in Essays
               in Criticism. As Josephine Guy explains, Arnold “uses it to designate an ‘inveterate
               inaccessibility to ideas’ in those Englishman deficient in liberal culture; later
               in Culture and Anarchy (1869) he uses it to indicate the prosaic materialism and anti-intellectualism
               of the middle classes” (383). Guy offers a theory in her introduction to the volume
               that Wilde’s spur of critical publications in 1888-9 may have emerged as a response
               to Pater (particularly the essay “Style”) and as a way of taking up literary criticism
               as a “role of the social critic. . .at the very center of cultural life,” a position
               left un-dominated by the death of Matthew Arnold (xxxiii-xxxiv).
            </p>
            				
            <p>73. Guy suggests Wilde is referring to D.A. Bingham’s 1884 A Selection from the Letters
               and Despatches of the First Napoleon. Also, Murray “comments that in Representative
               Men, Emerson described Napolean as ‘a boundless liar’” (Guy 387, quoting Murray 592).
               Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish Essayists and historian, was also a translator of many
               German Romantic works. His translations, as well as Sartor Resartus, were markedly
               influential on the American Transcendentalist movement, figure headed by Emerson,
               but which also included writers like Margaret Fuller and Henry David Thoreau. In fact,
               Edgar Allan Poe, alluded to by Wilde in works like “The Harlot’s House” and a key
               point of reference for British Decadent writers (and also, like Wilde, a habitual
               “self-plagiarist), continually criticized the New England Transcendentalists writers
               for the overt Carlylean style and conceits.
            </p>
            				
            <p>For example, in 1842, Poe derided Emerson’s prose for being obscurest and unintelligible:
               “Quintilian mentions a pedant who taught obscurity, and who once said to a pupil “this
               is excellent, for I do not understand it myself.” How the good man would have chuckled
               over Mr. E.! His present rôle seems to be the out-Carlyling Carlyle. Lycophron Tenebrosus
               is a fool to him” (“AN APPENDIX OF AUTOGRAPHS”).
            </p>
            				
            <p>Germane to Wilde’s Paterian influence and discussion of imitation, Poe invoked Carlyle
               in a short piece appearing in the January 22, 1845 issue of the Evening Mirror entitled,
               “American Diffuseness—Objectionable Concision.” After lamenting the “diffuseness of
               the American Legislative oratory,” Poe pivots his attention to the literary and “the
               species of concision which has been lately introduced among us, through imitation
               of that prophet in great and quack in little matters, Carlyle.” Prefiguring Pater’s
               understanding of “Style,” Poe argues that contrary to the goal of concision being
               “to save time... in saving thought... That style, therefore, is the most truly concise
               which most rapidly transmits the sense” (Edgar Allan Poe, “American Diffuseness —
               Objectionable Concision,” Evening Mirror, New York, vol. I, no. 91, January 22, 1845,
               p. 2, col. 2).
            </p>
            				
            <p>In the posthumously published “About Critics and Criticism,” he writes: “The manner
               of Carlyle is conventional — with himself. The style of Emerson is conventional —
               with himself and Carlyle. The style of Miss Fuller is conventional — with herself
               and Emerson and Carlyle: — that is to say, it is a triple-distilled conventionality:
               — and by the word “conventionality,” as here used, I mean very nearly what, as regards
               personal conduct, we style “affectation” — that is, an assumption of airs or tricks
               which have no basis in reason or common sense.”
            </p>
            				
            <p>See also Poe, “American Poetry”</p>
            				
            <p>74. Guy suggests that the “dense listing of references is a rhetorical strategy which
               occurs throughout Wilde's prose,” in-keeping with her argument in “Self-Plagiarism,
               Creativity and Craftsmanship in Oscar Wilde” about Wilde’s purposeful “self-plagiarism”
               a “self-conscious strategy” keenly aware of audience, potential reception, and affect.
               She argues, in short, he makes conscious choices, based on the topicality or generality
               of his jokes and whether they are likely to “work” with his audience, before reinserting
               or appropriating previously deployed jokes in a new work and context.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Schroeder disagrees, argues that “Wilde's list of names would have appeared less 'dense'
               if Guy had realized or if she had told her readers that it is clearly structured:
               Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages, 16th century, 18th century, 19th century”;
               “to accuse Wilde of academic showmanship shows a very low opinion of the general cultural
               competence of Wilde's readers and overlooks the fact that much that has been lost
               since the early 20th century and that must be retrieved with great effort was part
               of the living heritage in Victorian times”; and “thee cultural competence required
               to understand Wilde's 'dense listing of references' was not the privilege of a select
               few who could boast of having gone to Oxford or Cambridge, but was the common property
               of a large readership who had received a good education at home and at school” (40).
            </p>
            				
            <p>However, schools in which intense study of the classics would still be limited to
               the middle and upper-class citizens (See Robert Altic, British Common Reader 1800-1900).
            </p>
            				
            <p>References to most the Greek and Roman writers appear also in Wilde’s Historical Criticism
               and his Commonplace Book.

            <p>75. See “The Canterville Ghost,” chapter 3 of The Picture of Dorian Gray, and “The
               American Invasion” and “The American Man” for other critiques and jokes at the expense
               of Americans and American culture.
            </p>
            				
            <p>76. As Guy points out, this reference to “an extinct genus of a huge herbivorous animal
               resembling the modern sloth. . .is not as esoteric as it might seem. . .Emerson described
               how he had ‘just come from Professor Sedgwick’s Cambridge museum of megatheria and
               mastodon’s’” (Guy 387-388, quoting Emerson, v. 157).
            </p>
            				
            <p>77. Wilde similarly oscillates between gilded and golden on folio 52. Wilde’s revision
               here and below seems to reinforce the privileging of ostensible appearances, artifice,
               and presentation over some "real" "essence" or objective "truth.” The only subjective
               “truth” is in what we are able to create and present.
            </p>
            				
            <p>78. Guy and Schroeder disagree on the reference. Guy argues that Wilde “is probably
               referring to the Royal Society of Literature” which was “modelled on the much older
               and more famous Royal Society which dated from 1662” while Schroeder argues that it
               is a direct reference to the older of the two. The “Incorporated Authors” may, as
               Murray suggests, be “ an allusion to the ‘Society of Authors’” (Guy 388, Murray 593).
               The Society, to which Wilde had been elected a member of in 1887, was established
               in 1884 to “protect writers’ financial interests.” (Guy 388). He may have also had
               the 1888 banquet at Criterion Restaurant, which was held to “recognize the efforts
               of American Authors to gain international copyright” (Guy 388).
            </p>
            				
            <p>79. Francis Cowley Burnand was a loud critic of the aesthetes, especially in his role
               as he editor of Punch from 1880-1906.
            </p>
            				
            <p>80. Guy suggests this may be an allusion to Wordsworth’s “Intimations of Immortality.”
               Wilde cuts from the Berg variant the most explicit indictment of Realism and Naturalism
               for the mimetic “tenets,” by removing the reference to photography, which, it could
               be argued in a gross over-simplification, captures (purportedly) “life” at is “objectively”
               perceived in a single moment.
            </p>
            				
            <p>81. Guy points to “Wildes’s best-known aphorisms, in “The Nightingale and the Rose”
               an Act III of The Importance of being Earnest, but the clause appears to also be a
               clear reference to Pater’s “Style.” Pater writes, “The style, the manner, would be
               the man, not in his unreasoned and really uncharacteristic caprices, involuntary or
               affected, but in absolutely sincere apprehension of what is most real to him.” And
               “In the highest as in the lowliest literature, then, the one indispensable beauty
               is, after all, truth :—truth to bare fact in the latter, as to some personal sense
               of fact, diverted somewhat from men's ordinary sense of it, in the former ; truth
               there as accuracy, truth here as expression, that finest and most intimate form of
               truth, the vraie verite. And what an eclectic principle this really is ! employing
               for its one sole purpose— that absolute accordance of expression to idea— all other
               literary beauties and excellences whatever : how many kinds of style it covers, explains,
               justifies, and at the same time safeguards!” (Appreciations 36, 34).
            </p>
            				
            <p>82. Wilde has notes on Spencer’s work in Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy in
               his Commonplace Book.
            </p>
            				
            <p>83. A likely reference to the 19th Century rise in compiling statistics, which came
               about alongside the rise and formation of contemporary disciplines, scientific and
               otherwise, and their institutionalization by both Universities and the Government.
               See note to Blue-Books (where these government statistics were compiled) above. Wilde
               may have had Henry Buckle’s historiography and History of Civilization in England
               in mind here. See Guy 389-390.
            </p>
            				
            <p>84. Guy speculates that Wilde is here alluding to :an unsigned and partly critical
               review” by Alexander Ross on his own The Happy Prince and Other Tales (390).
            </p>
            				
            <p>85. Wilde omits the description of the non-European countries as “strange lands,”
               tamping down the overt othering within the essay itself, perhaps universalizing Art,
               but also betrays a clear Eurocentrism in keeping with predominant ideologies of the
               period.
            </p>
            				
            <p>86. Guy’s Notes and Queries article reports that, on the back of f19 of the Berg MS
               is a fair-copy of a review for Wyke Bayliss’s The Enchanted Isle, which came out the
               same month as “Decay of Lying”. Both sides carry allusions/direct references to Shakespeare’s
               The Tempest, forming the basis for her argument that Wilde’s notorious “Self-Plagiarism[s]”
               may actually be a result of complex drafting process where multiple drafts of the
               same and different pieces were being composed simultaneously. While this may not explain
               away extensive reusing's of whole passages, like his discussion of Balzac above, which
               is almost wholly lifted from his review published a few years prior, it does suggest
               an interestingly recursive composition process; a drafting process that would account
               for the initial reference to Caliban above that was replaced in the 1891 variant.
               Wilde’s writing in this recursive and reiterative fashion, in which he lifts and recontextualizes
               whole passages, may be yet another form of the type of “creative synthesis”(Bristow
               and Mitchell) or “absorption” and “communication with style” (Schiff) that enacts
               the aesthetic theory Schiff reads in essay (or a necessity when writing so prolifically).
               It is not “imitative” but a wholly new creation out of the very same material/constitutive
               parts. Moreover, it demonstrates that textual fluidity is not bounded by a single
               work-concept, but extends, as Van Hulle shows, throughout a whole oeuvre and another
               exemplar of “creative concurrence.” Ideas are articulated, rearticulated, reimagined
               amidst new contexts, even if the words are largely the same.
            </p>
            				
            <p>87. Wilde’s “inversion of Shakespeare’s lines may have been suggested to him by a
               definition of style given by the artist and Poet Selwyn Image in an 1887 lecture which
               Wilde reviewed for the Sunday Times” (Guy 390). As Guy quotes, Wilde paraphrased Image,
               writing, “Art. . .must not content itself simply with holding the mirror up to nature,
               for it’s a re-creation more than a reflection. . . it is no longer the duty of art
               to hold the mirror up to nature”
            </p>
            				
            <p>88. From Percy Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound. Lines copied into his Commonplace Book.</p>
            				
            <p>89. “Le Gallienne quoted these two sentences - in their original Nineteenth Century
               form - in his book on George Meredith, published in Nov. 1890: 'it is true that Art
               (to quote the beautiful words of Mr Oscar Wilde), ‘has flowers that no botanist knows
               of, birds that no museum possesses," that "she can bid the almond tree blossom in
               winter, and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield.’” (Schroeder 45).
            </p>
            				
            <p>90. Wilde significantly alters Cyril’s response for the 1891 edition. The shift from
               challenging or construing “lying” as “dangerous” to an affirmation may be a revision
               inflected by several factors. One may have been the rhetoric of reviewers like Alice
               Meynell, who wrote “The Decay of Lying” declares war, with all the irresponsibility
               naturally attending an act so serious in the history of the world” (“Unit of the World,”
               The Scots Observer, vol. 1 no. 11, February 2, 1889, 296-297).
            </p>
            				
            <p>The other would be the general reaction to the aesthetes and decadents as social and
               cultural deviants. Perhaps the revision would be an attempt to avoid provoking such
               connotations and reactions by explicitly calling to mind the socio-cultural danger
               of their radical aesthetic movement, and the other nonconformist positions the movement
               was associated with. The below mentioning of danger in association with paradox is
               qualified as only “seem[ing]” like a paradox.
            </p>
            				
            <p>91. References to the Pre-Raphelite panters Dante Garbiel Rossetti and Edward Burne
               Jones. Wilde praised Burne-Jones as “one of ‘the greatest masters of colour we have
               ever had in England’” (Guy 392).
            </p>
            				
            <p>92. 17th Century Flemish court painter. He “exercised a considerable influence on
               English portraiture; the National Gallery purchased a number of his works, including
               in 1885 the famous Equestrian portrait of Charles I.” See also Act I of An Ideal Husband.
               (Guy 392).
            </p>
            				
            <p>93. Guy draws attention to the “numerous public enquiries and legislative measures
               designed to improve public health, including the 1875 Artisan’s Dwelling act which
               empowered local authorities to make compulsory purchases of land to build new dwellings
               to house those most in need. These measures in turn were inspired by the pioneering
               Report on the Condition of the Labouring Classes by Edwin Chadwick which compiled
               a mass of data about the living conditions of the labouring classes, including numerous
               ‘sanitary’ maps and graphs correlation the worst instances of disease with dirt, overcrowding,
               and dilapidated dwellings” (393). However, Wilde’s initial choice of “beauty,” revised
               to condition, prioritizes aesthetic appearance, rather than the “condition.” Moreover,
               Wilde struck the class distinction for a generalizing “people,” only to reinject the
               class framework in Intentions, a trend of moving towards a more vocal elitism in in
               the later variants that suggests a growing consciousness of class or of class conflict.
            </p>
            				
            <p>94. The shift from “fact” to “word” echoes Pater’s distinction between the lesser
               “truth” of “fact” and the “higher,” more “intimate truth” of expression. It also shifts
               from “objective” to “subjective” understanding. See the use of Fact below
            </p>
            				
            <p>95. Schroeder erroneously notes, “Due to a grotesque printer's error, the 'silly boys'
               in the original periodical version of the essay, brandish 'loaded revolvers'” (48).
               In fact, “loaded” was a deliberate addition to the MS, while the “un” was only added
               in the 1891 edition. The original version seems to imply the threat of the poor youth
               in urban London attacking and preying on visiting “gentleman”, while the later variant,
               with the specific reference to “suburban lanes,” and the addition of “un” suggests
               that these are the “silly,” mischievous acts of wealthy middle and upper class, suburban
               boys who have access to the new, expensive novels (Price, Leah, “Victorian Reading.”
               The Cambridge History of Victorian Literature, ed. Kate Flint, Cambridge: Cambridge
               University Press, p. 40).
            </p>
            				
            <p>96. Reference to the Nihilist Philosophy and Russian movement, widles covered in the
               English newspapers of the time. Wilde positively reviewed these Russian novelists
               in the Pall Mall Gazette.
            </p>
            				
            <p>97. A leader of the French Revolution.</p>
            				
            <p>98. See again Wilde’s review of Balzac. The addition of “the stage” reinforces the
               “creative” aspect of art that gives form to the performance of life. See the addition
               of “creative vision” below, which again suggests art and culture structure our understanding
               and perception of “objective” reality.
            </p>
            				
            <p>99. Wilde here, again, delineates between “method” and “style.” Removal of the explanation
               of “her husband” injects ambiguity into the story.
            </p>
            				
            <p>100. “important center for gambling, and attracted a wealthy British clientele,” the
               Monte Carlo is also referenced in Dorian Gray and De Profundis.
            </p>
            				
            <p>101. See the North London areas in Charles Booth’s Map color coded black, or “Lowest
               class, Vicious, Semi-criminal” https://booth.lse.ac.uk/map/browse
            </p>
            				
            <p>102. Removal “the child” dehumanizes the “it” he sees in the “evil-looking streets.”
               And the Removal of “looking” linguistically renders the subjective impression a statement
               of objective “fact.”
            </p>
            				
            <p>103. As Guy notes, this closely mirrors Wilde’s own life, as he took his final exams
               in June 1878, and his degree was conferred in November of that year (396).
            </p>
            				
            <p>104. Wilde’s series of revisions literally exoticize the woman, and while careful
               to avoid using “nature,” character here seems to be aligned with the identity or “personality”
               of the subject that is expressed through art. The description of her as one who “would
               give herself up entirely to Art” and “a failure in all her transformations,” suggests,
               as frequently asserted by the Aesthetes and Decadent writers, a certain impossibility
               or inevitable failure in their artistic pursuits.
            </p>
            				
            <p>105. Wilde frequently levied harsh critiques at philanthropy. See The Soul of Man
               and De Profundis, for example (Guy 397).
            </p>
            				
            <p>106. May be reference to his own translation of Ivan Turgenev’s ‘A Fire at Sea’ (Guy
               397). The addition also firmly establishes the chronology of art first, life follows.
            </p>
            				
            <p>107. Reference to Giovanni Bellini, 15th and 16th Century painter praised by Ruskin
               and Symonds. The addition, added in 1891, may also signal an early contemplation of
               the decapation of John the Baptist that Wilde dramatized in Salome. For Bellini is
               one of the painter’s to whom The Head of John the Baptist held at the Civic Museum
               in Pesaro is attributed.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Guy also suggests that the mention of “gondolas” is an inside joke at the expense
               of Symonds, who “was notorious among a small circle of friends for his infatuation
               with a Venetian gondolier” (397).
            </p>
            				
            <p>108. Reference to the protagonist of the prominent French Romantic writer Alfred de
               Musset’s Rolla.
            </p>
            				
            <p>109. Who implemented the revision from René , an allusion to Chateaubriand’s influential
               novella, to an allusion to Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, is unknown. But
               both are key Romantic texts.
            </p>
            				
            <p>110. This lengthy passage is not, as Guy argues, a revised reinstatement, but entirely
               new material. However, whether it is a “part of [his] long quarrel with Whistler”
               or an echo of his beliefs expressed in other reviews, remains up to critical debate
               (Guy 398, Schroeder 52-3).
            </p>
            				
            <p>111. Guy writes that Wilde’s “understanding” of the “extremely complex. . .history
               of the reception of Impressionist art in Britain (and of the British school of Impressionists).
               . .[was] developed in part via his reading of Pater, encompassed poetry as well as
               painting, and was conflated (somewhat confusingly) with Romanticism” (398).
            </p>
            				
            <p>112. French landscape painter of the Barbizon school</p>
            				
            <p>113. French Impressionist painters.</p>
            				
            <p>114. “Other works - besides Lady Windermere's Fan - in which Wilde satirizes the vogue
               for sunsets are: first, 'The Relation of Dress to Art', Wilde's 'Note in Black and
               White on Mr Whistler's Lecture' (28 Febr. 1885), where he talks of 'a foolish sunset
               as a background'; second, 'The Canterville Ghost' (Febr. / March 1887) where Virginia
               accuses Sir Simon of having stolen all her reds, 'including the vermilion', so that
               she 'couldn't do any more sunsets'; and third, the review 'A Batch of Novels' (May
               1887) where Wilde praises Rosa Mulholland for her 'treatment of external nature' in
               her novel Marcella Grace : 'She never shrieks over scenery like a tourist, nor wearies
               us with sunsets like the Scotch school.'” (Schroeder 53).
            </p>
            				
            <p>115. English landscape painter, J.M.W. Turner, whose reputation was “defended” by
               Ruskin, leading to an explosion in popularity. “By the late 1880s, however, both Turner
               and Ruskin were thought old-fashioned” (Guy 399). 116. A renewed reference to René,
               which, as noted above, was cut in favor of an allusion to Werther. Vautrin is the
               central “master criminal” in Balzacs Comédie humaine. “Theodore Rousseau (1812-1867),
               the central figure of the Barbizon School” (Schroeder 54).
            </p>
            				
            <p>117. 17th Century Dutch Painter Aelbert Cuyp.</p>
            				
            <p>118. See Pater’s “Style”: “If music be the ideal of all art whatever, precisely because
               in music it is impossible to distinguish the form from the substance or matter, the
               subject from the expression” (37). 119. likely a reference to Ovid’s Metamorphoses
               specifically, Wilde “frequently” used the story of Apollo and Marsyas, “to trope artistic
               value” (Guy 401).
            </p>
            				
            <p>120. Allusion to Dante’s Il Paradiso and Pater.</p>
            				
            <p>121. The removal of “reflections” and “echoes” suggests a semiotic or representative,
               rather than re-presentation or remediation.
            </p>
            				
            <p>122. Wilde’s 1882 Lecture ‘The English Renaissance of Art’ “anticipates” this passage:
               ‘Those strange, wiled-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirl wind of ecstasy, those
               mighty limbed and Titan Prophets, labouring with the secret of the earth and the burden
               of mystery, the guard and glorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome­—do they not tell
               us more of the real spirit of the Italian Renaissance. . .than all the brawling boors
               and cooking women of Dutch art can teach us of the real spirit of the history of Holland”
               (Guy 402).
            </p>
            				
            <p>Again, Wilde’s reconfiguration of previous prose for new purposes and contexts exemplifies
               a self-reflexive adaptive revision. The fluid-text is not limited to the titular “work”
               but broader social and cultural contexts, ideas, and even precise language, impinge
               upon and make themselves known through the act of inscription.
            </p>
            				
            <p>123. The addition of “upon the other hand” furthers the discursive nature of the text,
               as dialogues and various perspectives are argued not only between speakers, but within
               speakers. And another layer of this discursive takes place between reader and writer,
               that occurs during the practice of writing, reading, and subsequent revisions.
            </p>
            				
            <p>124. The addition of the M.S.S. extends the realm of art to include literature.</p>
            				
            <p>125. The revision from “medium” to “presented” removes the possibility of “knowledge”
               of a “mediated” truth, but instead a purely aesthetic (subject-object perception)
               relationship.
            </p>
            				
            <p>126. Again, Art is construed as the purposeful expression of individuality and the
               unfiltered subjective experience.
            </p>
            				
            <p>127. This passage underwent heavy revision. The first significant change is the two
               separate removals of “photographs,” and instead goes to the “life”, the “real Japanese
               gentleman or lady,” removes any possibility of distortion through remediation, and
               focuses most explicitly on mimetic arts.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Then, the removal of “wonderful, strange, or imaginative” for “curious, or extraordinary”
               avoids any belittling (like the cut reference to Lilliput), but instead attempts to
               “normalize” the Japanese people. But, as Grace E. Lavery demonstrates, this rhetorical
               move doubly others and (violently) exoticizes Japan as both exceptional because it
               is not Britain, but also because it is not like the East and like Britain. This is,
               as Lavery points out, linguistically reified and enacted in words like “exquisite”
               which Wilde adds below. See Lavery, Grace E. Quaint, Exquisite: Victorian Aesthetics
               and the Idea of Japan. Princeton University Press, 2019. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvc77d7b.
            </p>
            				
            <p>Alluding to Mortimer Menpes, Guy suggests the cut reference to Velasquez was initially
               intended “to annoy Whistler. . . who was more usually associated with Velasquez. .
               .[and] who was by far the more accomplished painter.” In-line with her logic in “Self-Plagiarism”
               Guy suggests the joke was cut because “the joke no longer worked. . .because by 1891
               Menpes’s numerous one-man shows were proving to be extremely popular” (403).
            </p>
            				
            <p>128. This added section helps to clarify, in very problematic fashion, that it is
               art as culture that structures and frames our perception of “Nature” or the world
               around us, and that we always understand the world through our previous encounters
               with culture, rather than “Nature” informing our understanding of Art and Culture.

            <p>129. The revision features a provocative shift in agency.</p>
            				
            <p>130. Allusion to Frederick William Henry Meyers, the President and co-founder of the
               Society for Psychal Research, and his two-volume Phantasms of the Living. Wilde mocks
               him in “The Canterval Ghost,” “Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime,” and his review of Rhoda
               Broughton’s Betty’s Visions (Guy 405; Schroeder 57).
            </p>
            				
            <p>The shift from “probable” to “tedious” alters the temporality from prolonged and boring

            </p>
            				
            <p>131. As Guy notes, Wilde here is alluding “to the mythopoeic quality of religion.
               . .largely for comic effect; however, when he revisits the idea in De Profundis it
               is discussed with much greater seriousness” (Guy 405).
            </p>
            				
            <p>In the MS, “belief” and “disbelief” are mirrored over the line break, giving the sentence
               figural and material symmetry.
            </p>
            				
            <p>132. Guy explains that a “passman” was a “student who graduated from Oxford or Cambridge
               with a minimum pass rather than honours degree; the latter qualification required
               a more detailed programme of reading and more rigorous examinations” (405).
            </p>
            				
            <p>133. Passage pulled from deleted content on 48A</p>
            				
            <p>134. Guy suggests that “Vivian’s comment is of course a joke about the Victorian thirst
               for education of all kinds; however it may also reflect Wilde’s own distinction between
               the amateur raconteur and the professional (that is, non-university) lecturer who
               was paid for his services” (406).
            </p>
            				
            <p>135. Quote from William Morris’s 1887 translation of The Odyssey of Homer, which Wilde
               reviewed for the Paul Mall Gazette in April and Nov. 1887 (Guy 406-407). Of the deletion,
               Schroeder writes: “In Guy's opinion, the original Nineteenth Century version 'may
               be a reference to Samuel Henry Butcher, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who
               published a popular translation of the Odyssey in 1879' (in collaboration with Andrew
               Lang). But this does not make sense, as Butcher / Lang do not use the word 'whopper'”
               (58).
            </p>
            				
            <p>The shift from an incredulous “whopper” to “sly” deceit furthers the suggestion that
               “lying” with a purpose of deception or conscious craft, as distinct from “self-conscious”
               creation/invention, are two distinct acts in Wilde’s aesthetic theory (as put forth
               here).
            </p>
            				
            <p>136. The agent behind the change from “rose” to “grew”—with all its natural/organic
               implication—is undocumented. The revisions of “young” to “mankind” addition of “important”
               while replacing “whole” further down (around the “question”), all amplify the stakes
               of the discourse.
            </p>
            				
            <p>137. An allusion to Quod Nihil Sictur [That Nothing is Known], by Jesuit scholar,
               Francisco Sanchez (Guy 407).
            </p>
            				
            <p>138. As Guy summarizes: “district School Boards were the product of the 1870 Education
               Act which made elementary schooling compulsory for children aged 5-12. In order to
               meet this provision, the existing structure of private and church schools had to be
               supplemented by a network of new state-sponsored institutions funded directly from
               taxation. These new schools were administered by a directly elected Board which had
               the power to levy a local education rate to run the school and to compel attendance”
               (408). See also Barnard, H. C. A Short History of English Education from 1760 to 1944.

            <p>The removal of “moral” expands the range of “improvement” implied (intellectual, professional,

            <p>139. Center of London Newspaper industry. For Wilde’s critique of journalism, see
               "Pen, Pencil, and Poison” in which Wilde, writing of Thomas Griggiths Wainewright,
               humorously writes that it’s a tragedy that his most successful and “influen[tial]”
               writing was his journalistic style: “To have a style so gorgeous that it conceals
               the subject is one of the highest achievements of an important and much admired school
               of Fleet Street leader-writers, and this school Janus Weathercock may be said to have
               invented. . .A publicist, now-a-days, is a man who bores the community with the details
               of the illegalities of his private life” (114-115). Later, discussing Wainewright’s
               exile, the punishment for his crimes, jokingly laments, “there is, however, something
               dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted for, what, if we remember
               his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst
               of all his sins” (118-119).
            </p>
            				
            <p>140. This cut sentence makes the case more explicitly, as Hilda Schiff argues, that
               Wilde construed “lying” as an absolute “freedom” from the structuring of our subjective
               experience by culture, which becomes apparent in mimetic efforts. In turn, lying is
               thus an assertion of individuality.
            </p>
            				
            <p>141. For more on Wilde’s careful delineation between types of “lying,” See note 135
               paragraph 2.
            </p>
            				
            <p>142. As Schroeder reports: “The 'solid stolid British intellect' seems to have been
               a popular cliché in late Victorian times. In his Essays on Poetry and Poets, a collection
               which Wilde reviewed in Dec. 1886 , Roden Noel (1834-94), for example, speaks of 'the
               stolid, practical, but rather obtuse English mind.' And for Lady Wilde, not surprisingly,
               stolidness seems to have been likewise the dominant English character trait, if we
               can believe the Athenaeum reviewer of her volume on Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages
               of Ireland who took great pains to quote all the passages where the word 'stolid'
               occurred and who cried out at the end in protest” (58).

            <p>144. "golden" in Berg; See similar revision series on Folio 28. Wilde's revision here
               seems to reinforce the privileging of ostensible appearances, artifice, and presentation
               over some "real" "essence" or objective "truth"
            </p>
            				
            <p>145. A revision that suggests Pater’s Renaissance and his writing was synonymous with
               the Aesthetic movement.
            </p>
            				
            <p>146. As Josephine Guy writes, “The idea that late Greak art received forms and techniques
               from an earlier period had been suggested by Walte Pater in his essay ‘The Beginnings
               of Greek Sculpture’. . .Pater argued that the work of Phidias expressed certain qualities
               anticipated in the work of Homer” (409).
            </p>
            				
            <p>Schroeder notes, Wilde’s assertion here was re-articulated in his “review 'Mr William
               Morris's Last Book' (March 1889): 'From an artistic point of view it [Morris's Tale
               of the House of the Wolfings] may be described as an attempt to return by a self-conscious
               effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age. Attempts of this kind are
               not uncommon in the history of art. From some such feeling came the Pre-Raphaelite
               movement of our own day and the archaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.'” (59).
            </p>
            				
            <p>Guy also notes that “Wilde is referring to the influence of the original Pre-Raphaelite
               Brotherhood, founded in 1848, on a later generation of artists and poets, such as
               Burne-Jones, Swinburne, William Morris, and of course Wilde himself” (410).
            </p>
            				
            <p>147. Revisions shift the sentence from an implication of perspective to act “commit[ted]”</p>
            				
            <p>148. This final sentence suggests that, for Wilde, to mimic is to be behind, to lie
               is to create, and to influence culture through the creation of art is to augment the
               cultural frameworks which structure our future perceptions and encounters with the
               world. And in this way, art becomes anticipatory of life and provides “form” for the
               “expression of Life,” as signaled in the paragraph below and expanded upon in the
               below addition, beginning with “it follows,” to the 1891 edition. See also Wilde’s
               differentiation between the redeemable “lying for its own sake” and other forms of
               non-artistic/creative lying.
            </p>
            				
            <p>149. As Schroeder notes: “things, is the proper aim of Art. Vivian's 'final revelation'
               served as the climax in Punch's little rhymed satire 'In Defence of the Great Paradoxist'
               (May 1892): 'He may not be "earnest," he may not be "smart," / You may say, if you
               please, he's unable to sing; / But, oh, you must own he's a "work of art," - / A "beautiful
               untrue thing!"'”

            <p>150. Allusions to Tennyson’s The Prncess and William Blake’s “To the Evening Star.”
               And, as Schroeder observes, “The two quotations recall Swinburne's essay on Blake
               (1866) - the essay, it will be remembered, gave Wilde the title for 'Pen, Pencil and
               Poison' in which Swinburne singled out the line from Blake's ode 'To the Evening Star'
               for particular praise and put it side by side with the poetry of Tennyson” (59).
