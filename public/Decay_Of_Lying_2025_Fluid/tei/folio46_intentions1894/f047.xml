Do you think that Greek<lb/> art ever tells us what the Greek <lb/>people are like? Do you believe that <lb/>the Athenian women were like the stately<lb/> dignified figures of the Parthenon<lb/> frieze, or like those marvellous <lb/>goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building? If you<lb/> judge from the art, they certainly were so.</p>
