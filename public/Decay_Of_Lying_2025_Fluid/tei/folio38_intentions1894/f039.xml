He was, however, very closely followed, and finally he took refuge in a <lb/>surgery, the door of which happened to<lb/> be open, where<milestone facs="#f039_z006" unit="caret"/> he explained to a young<lb/> assistant, who<lb/><add change="#StE" facs="#f039_z027" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions_1894"> was serving </add>there, exactly what had<lb/> occurred.
