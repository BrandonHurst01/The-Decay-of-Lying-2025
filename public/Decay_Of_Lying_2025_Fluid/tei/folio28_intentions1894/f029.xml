I assure you it is the case, and the amusing part of the whole<lb/> thing is that the story of the cherry<lb/>-tree is an absolute myth. However, <lb/>you must not think that I am<lb/> too despondent about the artistc <milestone facs="#f029_z004" unit="caret"/>future either <lb/>of America or of our own country. Listen<lb/> to this:--<lb/></p>
					<p>"That some change will take place<lb/> before this century has drawn to its<lb/> close we have no doubt whatsoever.<lb/> Bored by the tedious and improving <lb/>conversation of those who have neither<lb/> the wit to exaggerate nor the <lb/>genius to romance, tired of the<lb/> intelligent person whose reminiscences<lb/> are always based upon memory, whose<lb/> statements are invariably limited by<lb/> probability, and who is at any time<lb/> liable to be corroborated by the<lb/> merest Philistine who happens to be <lb/>present, Society sooner or later must <lb/>return to its lost leader, the cultured<lb/> and fascinating liar. Who he was<lb/> who first, without ever having gone<lb/> out to the rude chase, told the <lb/>wondering cave-men at sunset how he <lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/> had dragged the Megatherium from <lb/>the purple darkness of its jasper<lb/> cave, or slain the Mammoth in<lb/> single combat and brought back its gilded tusks, we cannot tell, and<lb/> not one of our <milestone n="nc_46"/>modern<milestone n="intentions_24"/>anthropologists,</p>
