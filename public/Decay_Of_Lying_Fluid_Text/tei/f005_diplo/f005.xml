Not<lb/> I. Like Emerson, I write over the door<lb/> of my library the word " "Whim."<note>A reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance." In the essay, Emerson writes that the two "terrors" of self-reliance are conformity and consistency. He writes: "The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. . . A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.--'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.'--Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood." Guy notes that Wilde frequently referenced Emerson throughout his career, and even requested a volume of his essays while in prison.</note> Besides<lb/> my article is really a most salutary<lb/> and valuable warning. If it is<lb/> attended to, there may be a new<lb/> Renaissance of Art.<note>See also Wilde's 1882 lecture "The English Renaissance of Art" for a similar argument (Guy 363).</note><lb/></p>
