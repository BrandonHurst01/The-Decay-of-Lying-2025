Well, before you read it to me, I<lb/> should like to ask you a question.<lb/> What do you mean by saying that<lb/> life, "poor, probable, uninteresting human life," will try to reproduce the<lb/> marvels of art? I can quite<lb/> understand your objection to <del change="#StE" facs="#f033_z015">A</del><add change="#StE" facs="#f033_z015" place="intentions_1894">a</add>rt<lb/> being treated as a mirror. You<lb/> think it would reduce genius to<lb/> the position of a crackedlooking-glass.<lb/> But you don't mean to say that <lb/>you seriously believe that Life imitates<lb/> Art, that Life in fact is the<lb/> mirror, and Art the reality?</p>
