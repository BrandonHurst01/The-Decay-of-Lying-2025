					<p>It follows, as a corollary from this, that <lb/>external Nature also imitates Art. The only <lb/>effects that she can show us are effects<lb/> that we have already seen through <lb/>poetry, or in paintings. This is the secret of <lb/>Nature's charm, as well as the <lb/>explanation of Nature's weakness. <lb/></p>
					<p>The final revelation is that Lying, the<lb/> telling of beautiful untrue <milestone n="nc_56"/>things, is the<lb/> proper aim of Art. But of this I<lb/> think I have spoken at sufficient length.<lb/> And now let us go out on the terrace, where "droops the milk-white peacock <lb/>like a ghost," while the evening star "washes <lb/>the dusk with silver." At twilight<lb/> nature becomes a wonderfully suggestive effect,<lb/> and is not without loveliness, though <lb/>perhaps its chief use is to <lb/>illustrate quotations from the<lb/> poets. Come! We have talked long <lb/>enough.<lb/></p>
