But from the standpoint of<lb/>art, what can be said in favour<lb/> of the author of <hi change="#StC" facs="#f013_z003" hand="#comp" rend="italic">L'Assommoir</hi>, <hi change="#StC" facs="#f013_z003" hand="#comp" rend="italic">Nana</hi>, and <hi change="#StC" facs="#f013_z003" hand="#comp" rend="italic">Pot- Bouille</hi>? Nothing. Mr Ruskin<lb/> once described the characters in George<lb/> Eliot's novels as being like<lb/> <q facs="#f013_z004">the<lb/> sweepings of a Pentonville omnibus</q>,<note>Fiction – Fair and Foul V’, Nineteenth Century, 10 (1881), 521</note> but<lb/> M. Zola's characters are much worse.<lb/> They have their dreary vices, and their drearier<lb/> virtues. The record of their lives is absolutely<lb/> without interest. Who cares what happens to<lb/> them? In literature we require distinction, charm,<lb/> beauty, and imaginative power. We don't want to<lb/> be harrowed and disgusted with an account of<lb/> the doings of the lower orders. M. Daudet is<lb/> better. He has wit,<milestone n="intentions_12"/> a light touch, and an<lb/> amusing style. But he has lately committed<lb/> literary suicide. Nobody can possibly care for<lb/> Delobelle with his 'Il faut lutter pour l'art,'<lb/> or for Valmajour with his eternal refrain about<lb/> the nightingale, or for the poet in <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> with <lb/>his 'mots cruels,'' now that we have learned from <lb/><hi rend="italic">Vingt Ans de ma Vie littéraire</hi> that these characters<lb/> weretaken directly from life. To us they seem to<lb/> have suddenly lost all their vitality, all the<lb/> few qualities they ever possessed. The only real<lb/> people are the people who never existed; and if<lb/> a novelist is base enough to go to life for<lb/> his personages, he should at least pretend <lb/>that they are creations, and not boast of them<lb/> as copies. The justification of a character in a novel is not that other persons are what they are, but that the author is what he is. Otherwise the novel is not a work of art. As for M. Paul Bourget,</p>
