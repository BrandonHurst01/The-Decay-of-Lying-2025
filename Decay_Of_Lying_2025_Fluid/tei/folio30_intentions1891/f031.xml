Both sides carry allusions/direct references to Shakespeare’s The Tempest, forming the basis for her argument that Wilde’s notorious “Self-Plagiarism[s]” may actually be a result of complex drafting process where multiple drafts of the same and different pieces were being composed simultaneously. While this may not explain away extensive reusing's of whole passages, like his discussion of Balzac in “The Decay of Lying” which is almost wholly lifted from his review published a few years prior, it does suggest an interestingly recursive composition process. Wilde’s writing in this recursive and reiterative fashion, in which he lifts and recontextualizes whole passages, may be yet another form of the type of “creative synthesis”(Bristow and Mitchell) or “absorption” and “communication with style” (Schiff) that enacts the aesthetic theory Schiff reads in essay (or a necessity when writing so prolifically). It is not “imitative” but a wholly new creation out of the very same material/constitutive parts. Moreover, it demonstrates that textual fluidity is not bounded by a single work-concept, but extends, as Van Hulle shows, throughout a whole oeuvre and another exemplar of “creative concurrence.” Ideas are articulated, rearticulated, reimagined amidst new contexts, even if the words are largely the same.</note> and the fairies singing to each<lb/> other in a wood near Athens, who<lb/> led the phantom kings in dim procession<lb/> across the misty Scottish heath, and<lb/> hid Hecate in a cave with the weird <lb/>sisters.
