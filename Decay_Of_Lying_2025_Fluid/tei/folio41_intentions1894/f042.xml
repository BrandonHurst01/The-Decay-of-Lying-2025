Personal<lb/><milestone facs="#f042_z002" unit="guiding_line"/> experience is a most vicious and limited circle. <lb/>All that I desire to point out is<lb/> the general principle that Life imitates<lb/> Art far more than Art imitates Life,<lb/> and I feel sure that if you think<lb/> seriously about it you will find<lb/> that it is true. Life holds the mirror<lb/> up to Art, and either reproduces some<lb/> strange type imagined by <milestone facs="#f042_z007" unit="guiding_line"/>painter or sculptor, or<lb/> realises in fact what has been<lb/> dreamed in fiction. Scientifically speaking,<lb/> the basis of life--the energy of life,<lb/> as Aristotle would call it--is simply<lb/> the desire for expression, and Art is<lb/> always presenting various forms through<lb/> which this <milestone facs="#f042_z011" unit="caret"/>expression can be attained. Life <lb/>seizes on them and uses them, even if <lb/>they be to her own hurt. Young men<lb/> have committed suicide because Rolla<lb/> did so, have<milestone n="intentions 32"/> died by their own hand<lb/> because by his own hand Werther died.<lb/> Think of what we owe to the<lb/> imitation of Christ, of what we owe<lb/> to the imitation of Cæsar. <lb/></p>

					<p><hi rend="italic">Vivian</hi>. Certainly. Where, if not from the Impressionists,<lb/> do we get those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping<lb/> down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and changing<lb/> the houses into monstrous shadows? To whom, if not to <lb/>them and their master, do we owe the lovely silver mists<lb/> that brood over our river, and turn to faint forms of<lb/> fading grace curved bridge and swaying barge? The <lb/>extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate<lb/> of London during the last ten years is entirely due to<lb/> this particular school of Art. You smile. Consider the <lb/>matter from a scientific or a metaphysical point of view,<lb/> and you will find that I am right. For what is Nature?<lb/> Nature is no great mother who has borne us. She is our <lb/>creation. It is in our brain that she quickens to life.<lb/> Things are because we see them, and what we see, and<lb/> how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced<lb/> us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a<lb/> thing. One does not see anything until one sees its<lb/> beauty. Then, and then only, does it come into existence.<lb/> At present, people see fogs, not because there<lb/><milestone n="intentions_35"/> are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught <lb/>them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There<lb/> may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say <lb/>there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not<lb/> know anything about them. They did not exist until<lb/> Art had invented them. Now, it must be admitted, fogs<lb/> are carried to excess. They have become the mere<lb/> mannerism of a clique, and the exaggerated realism of<lb/> their method gives dull people bronchitis. Where the<lb/> cultured catch an effect, the uncultured catch cold.<lb/> And so, let us be humane, and invite Art to turn her<lb/> wonderful eyes elsewhere. She has done so already,<lb/> indeed. That white quivering sunlight that one sees<lb/> now in France, with its strange blotches of mauve, and <lb/>its restless violet shadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the<lb/> whole, Nature produces it quite admirably. Where she<lb/> used to give us Corots and Daubignys, she gives us now <lb/>exquisite Monets and entrancing Pisaros. Indeed there<lb/> are moments, rare, it is true, but still to be observed from<lb/> time to time, when Nature becomes absolutely modern. <lb/>Of course she is not always to be relied upon. The fact <lb/>is that she is in this unfortunate position. Art creates<lb/> an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so,<lb/> passes on to other things. Nature, upon the other hand, <lb/>forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form<lb/> of insult, keeps on repeating this effect until we all <lb/>become absolutely wearied of it. Nobody of any real <lb/>culture, for instance, ever talks now<add change="#StE" hand="#comp" place="intentions_1894">-</add>a<add change="#StE" hand="#comp" place="intentions_1894">-</add>days about the<lb/> beauty of the sunset. Sunsets are quite old-fashioned.<lb/> They belong to the time when Turner was the last note<lb/> in Art. To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism<milestone n="intentions_51"/> of temperament. Upon the other hand<del change="#StE" hand="#comp">,</del> they go on.<lb/> Yesterday evening Mrs. Arundel insisted on my <add change="#StE" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions_1894">coming </add><del change="#StE" hand="#Wilde">going </del>to<lb/> the window, and looking at the glorious sky, as she called<lb/> it. Of course<del change="#StE" hand="#comp">,</del> I had to look at it. She is one of those<lb/> absurdly pretty Philistines, to whom one can deny<lb/> nothing. And what was it? It was simply a very<lb/> second-rate Turner, a Turner of a bad period, with all<lb/> the painter's worst faults exaggerated and over-emphasized.<lb/> Of course, I am quite ready to admit that Life<lb/> very often commits the same error. She produces her<lb/> false Renés and her sham Vautrins, just as Nature gives<lb/> us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp, and on another a more<lb/> than questionable Rousseau. Still, Nature irritates one<lb/> more when she does things of that kind. It seems so<lb/> stupid, so obvious, so unnecessary. A false Vautrin<lb/> might be delightful. A doubtful Cuyp is unbearable.<lb/> However, I don't want to be too hard on Nature. I wish<lb/> the Channel, especially at Hastings, did not look quite<lb/> so often like a Henry Moore, grey pearl with yellow<lb/> lights, but then, when Art is more varied, Nature will,<lb/> no doubt, be more varied also. That she imitates Art,<lb/> I don't think even her worst enemy would deny now.<lb/> It is the one thing that keeps her in touch with civilized<lb/> man. But have I proved my theory to your satisfaction. <lb/></p>
