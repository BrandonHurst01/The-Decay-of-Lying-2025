No, the <lb/>politicians won't do,. Something may, <lb/>perhaps, be urged on behalf of the Bar. <lb/>The mantle of the Sophist has fallen<lb/> on its members.

Newspapers, even, have degenerated. <lb/>They may now be absolutely relied upon.<lb/> One feels it as one wades through their columns.<lb/> It is always the unreadable that occurs.<lb/> I am afraid that there is not much to be<lb/> said in favour of either the lawyer<lb/> or the journalist. besides, what<lb/> I am pleading for is Lying in<lb/> art.
