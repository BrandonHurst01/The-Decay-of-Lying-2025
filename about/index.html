Mitchel reported the (re)discovery of the Oscar Wilde’s famous essay, “The Decay of Lying.” The fair copy manuscript delivered to the editors and typesetters of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Nineteenth Century</i> for periodical publication in 1889, long presumed to have “either been destroyed or (more likely) that it remained in private hands” resurfaced in 2012 when University of Akron’s University Archivist S. Victor Fleischer added it to the library’s digital catalogue (PR5818.d43 1889; Guy xl). The manuscript had changed hands at private auctions and sales numerous times over the course of the first half of the 20th Century, but its precise location remained unknown for nearly three-quarters of a century (Bristow and Mitchell 573–74).<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-1" id="ref-note-1" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>1</a></sup> The manuscript (henceforth referred to as the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS) had actually been donated to the University of Akron in 1962 in the second of two rounds of donations to the University’s rare book collection by Herman Muehlstein (574). How the manuscript made its way into his private collection remains undocumented, but it remained “undisturbed” in Akron’s collection until 2012. </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>As Bristow and Mitchell document, “The absence of the manuscript from the scholarly record and from readers’ perusal means that it has survived in excellent condition, rebound in leather but otherwise untouched. Wilde’s text is written in black ink on fifty-five recto pages”: fifty-four numbered folios with pages labelled 48A and 48B. There are ink and pencil revisions in Wilde’s hand; pencil marks including brackets, strikethroughs, signatures, and punctuation corrections in the hand of multiple typesetters; and sparse blue-pencil inscriptions likely by typesetters are also extant.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Bristow and Mitchell’s uncovering brought valuable new evidence to investigate, bringing new knowledge to Wilde, Textual, and Book History studies. When the essay appeared in Volume IV of Oxford’s <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde</i> series in 2007, edited by Josephine Guy, the only known surviving manuscript was the fragmented version of “discontinuous sheets” (likely including material from multiple drafts) held in The New York Public Library’s Berg Collection (hereafter <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Berg</i>; xxxvii, xxxix). Thus, much about how and why the text changed, and what this meant for understanding the composition, printing, and publishing of the work, was drawn largely from inference and contextual evidence. But in 2017, Bristow and Mitchell assembled a print-transcription of the manuscript, accompanied by an illuminating introductory essay, that clarified many debates about work’s variants and Wilde’s creative process (see Horst Schroder’s discursive notes responding to Guy’s editing). While their print edition brings clarity to certain Wilde questions, it raises several fascinating questions about textual “stability” or “fluidity,” the editing of a “work,” the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>materiality</i> of composition, and forces inflecting textual transmission that are hyper- (or only) legible in its variants. The present edition of Wilde’s essay, by leveraging the unique affordances of digital tools, centers these questions, enabling reading that can enhance and enrich our understanding Wilde, the nineteenth-century, literary creation, and cultural movements more broadly.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Thanks to the generosity of the University of Akron’s Herman Muehlstein Rare Book Collection, facsimile images of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS were created in September of 2025. I then converted these images into IIIF format (allowing for zoning and encoding of the images) and created the present edition tracking not only the revisions to the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS but changes across the initial variants of the essay. The “Edition Crafter” format, created by and available through <a href=" https://www.performantsoftware.com/" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> Performant Software</a>, was chosen since it enables an easy reading of different versions of the text—and the variants introduced at each stage—alongside dynamic MS images (a uniquely digital affordance). Further detail about the viewing options can be found in the <a href="#using-the-edition" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“Using the Edition”</a> section below.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> As an editor, my hope is that The Fluid Text Edition of Oscar Wilde’s “The Decay of Lying” proves a valuable research resource and pedagogical tool. The goal is to aid researchers’, teachers’, and students’ engagement with the materiality of textual and literary studies and explore the rich interpretive possibilities and insights such considerations afford. In creating this edition which maps the differences in the texts of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS, 1889 periodical publication, 1891 version included in the first edition of <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Intentions</i>, and 1894 second edition of <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Intentions</i>, I follow the invaluable editorial and critical scholarship of Bristow and Mitchell who transcribed the manuscript with extensive (but not quite exhaustive) notes on variations between the MS and the 1889 publication as well as notable variations from content in the extant <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Berg</i> holograph. Like Bristow and Mitchell’s editorial contribution, the present edition is not designed “to supplant or supersede their account,” and I too draw upon both Horst Schroder’s and Josephine Guy’s “indispensable observations” about the essay (99). The work of these scholars heavily informed the editorial assembly practices and decisions, and their respective commentaries formed the basis of many of the explanatory notes to the <a href=" https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/records/" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Reading Text</a>. This edition is meant to complement their astounding editorial work by creating allowing readers to engage directly with facsimile evidence and explore the untapped hermeneutical possibilities to be found in investigating the essay in its genesis and variations. My critical contribution based on close analysis of this edition comes in the form of a demonstration of possible uses of the edition and methods of critical inquiry it enables. See the <a href="#analytical-introduction" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“Analytical Introduction”</a> below.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>A "Fluid Text" Edition:</b><br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
The term "Fluid Text," “any literary work that exists in more than one version,” was introduced by John Bryant and taken up (under various nomenclature) by scholars digital editing and criticism such as Paul Eggert, Dirk Van Hulle, and Elena Pierazzo. The fluid or "living-text" (Eggert) concept, as an editorial and critical framework, theorizes a way of exploring the rich significance in what has previously been termed textual "instability." Bryant offers the fluid text concept and theory as a way of rethinking the “work-concept.” Bryant problematizes the notion of an “authoritative” or “fixed” version of any text, the predominant "one-text culture" (Pierazzo) or "single-text logic" (Van Hulle) at the foundation of most literary studies. As Bryant concisely states “all works—because of the nature a of texts and creativity—are fluid texts. . .it is inherent in the phenomena of writing itself. . .Literary works invariably exist in more than one version, either in early manuscript forms, subsequent print edition, or even adaptation. . .the processes of authorial, editorial, and cultural revision that create theses versions are inescapable” (1). Bryant rejects the disciplinary convention of assembling a single critical text because “the smoothness of the reading text, a hallmark of critical editing, in effect denies us an immediate awareness of the actual roughness of the textual record, and textuality itself” (27). He reframes what the “roughness” of textual “instability” as a remarkably generative and rich potentiality for scholarship. Whereas textual “instability” or “indeterminacy” situates the labor of editing as an effort to “smooth” or solidify textual precarity, a “fluid” text and “textual fluidities” not only accounts for, but embraces as a hermeneutically significant, the “flow of creativity” and the inherently social processes and inflections on the act of writing (as opposed to isolated authorship) (5-6). He also argues that the concept of the fluid-text makes room to take into account intention as an instantiation of broader socio-cultural movements. Situating his theory in conversation with Foucault and Derrida, Bryant argues, “a fluid text bodies forth concrete instances of an idiosyncratic individual negotiating idiosyncratically with an audience. Such idiosyncrasies cannot represent a cultural, but as a particularized instance of cultural engagement, they may be seen in their peculiarity as a concrete enactment of culture. . .they are a graphic manifestation of the discourses of self, word, and society” (9). </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The approach of this fluid or living text edition is to enact many of the principles of Bryant’s, Eggert’s, Pierrazzo's, and Van Hulle’s editorial theories. Putting into practice the idea of multivalent, fluid, and living text, the present edition of Wilde’s essay seeks to direct readers to the realization that texts are yes, authored, but they are also bound up in broader cultural influences and “the socialised circumstances that gave rise to it” (4). For Wilde’s “The Decay of Lying,” the most immediate and literally legible evidence of such “socialised circumstances” is the polyphonic nature of the material folios. Throughout the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS are the pencil marks of typesetters that sporadically mark-up, interject, and augment the text. And their penciled signatures loudly (and far more prominent than Wilde’s comparatively small, ink signature) overwrite fragments of text—taking a vocal, if unseen in print, ownership in and authorial contribution to the essay.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>This edition’s representations of Wilde's, and other agents, iterative reconfigurations of the essay can and should be read as creative, authorial choices, but they can also be read as acts always inflected by—and discursively engaged with—broader literary, social, cultural, and political moments, movements, and ideologies. As Wilde (drawing on Pater) argues in the essay, Art frames and molds our subjective impression and interpretation of experience, which in turn shapes and informs the art we create. And in his critical writings, whether through the “self-conscious” act of purposeless “lying” or in his philosophies of criticism and the critic, Wilde offers an aesthetic theory that attempts to counter and respond to this <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>re</i>mediative aesthetic cycle (see Danson, Green 399, Riquelme, Small 118-119, and Sussman). Yet his project (evidenced to his use of his own writings and his conceptual similarities to the work of some of his contemporaries as demonstrated by Bristow and Mitchell, Guy, and Schroder), like many artistic and literary efforts of the decadent writers and <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>fin-de-siècle</i> aesthetes, is an impossible achievement doomed to failure (even if the attempt is, in the scheme of things, generative). For no artist can ever escape or get outside the cultural and social structures that literally and figuratively frame and shape artistic output. But, hopefully aided by resources like the present edition, we can come to recognize and acknowledge these forces.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The impingement of cultural and political ideologies upon Wilde’s crafting of the essay can be found in the series of revisions Wilde’s passing references to class.<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-2" id="ref-note-2" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>2</a></sup> Writing of the “silly boys who, after reading the adventures of Jack Sheppard or Dick Turpin, pillage the stalls of unfortunate apple women, and alarm old gentlemen,” on f.35, Wilde adds to the MS the phrase “who are returning home from the city” drawing a clear distinction between the “vulgar” boys of the urban London and its upper-class suburban population. Indeed, in the manuscript, Wilde adds the specification that their revolvers are “loaded,” contrary to Schroeder’s contention that this was an erroneous misprint, making clear that the imitating urban boys pose a dangerous threat to suburban population (48). This overt classism is disguised the later variant; the specific reference to “suburban lanes,” and the addition of “un” to loaded, suggests that these are the “silly,” mischievous acts of wealthy middle and upper class, suburban boys who have access to the new, expensive novels (Price, Leah, “Victorian Reading.” <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Cambridge History of Victorian Literature</i>, ed. Kate Flint, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 40). </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Similarly, on the preceding folio, when Wilde wrote “ We try to improve the <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>beauty</s> <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>conditions</b> of the race by means of good air, free sunlight, wholesome water, and hideous bare buildings for the better housing of the <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>lower orders,</b>” he originally wrote “lower-classes,” making clear his association of violence and “ugliness” with the lower and working class. However, he struck this phrase, replacing it with “people,” removing the overt class connection in periodical publication (f.34). But when returning to the passage in 1891, he again revised the phrase, changing it to “lower orders,” again inserting an overt class hierarchy into the passage. With their direct connection to Wilde’s understanding of “beauty,” and the assertion that “these things merely produce health, they do not produce beauty,” these revisions make apparent a cultural elitism inflecting Wilde’s aesthetic theories. The revised restoration reinserts a differentiation between those who create art and those who consume and are affected by it, as well as the culture of dissensus within the creatives’ space: between realism and what Wilde construes as “Romanticism.” His articulations of these divisions reveal not just a more pronounced sense of cultural hierarchies that structures the 1891 edition Wilde’s essay, but make clear that they were always present even if not as apparently visible.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>In Paul Eggert's <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Work and the Reader in Literary Studies: Scholarly Editing and Book History</i>, he outlines the limitations of scholarly editing and the production of scholarly editions of texts, arguing for a living model that draws both upon the epistemologies of book history and literary critics for a semiotics and hermeneutics of editing. Eggert's model reads and re-presents texts as socially produced “living works” or “work embodied,” that take into account and attempt to both interpret and present the “relations of documents to versions, versions to works, and works to adaptations. . .” and the ways these are “played out by readers on agented documents, whether print or digital” (9). His model imbricates literary criticism, editing, book history, and readers. Editors are literary critics that are making a claim about the text in the act of re-presenting it (a claim borne out and evidenced by the editorial choices): “the texts of works never come down to us in unmediated form, every scholarly edition is necessarily an embodied argument about the text or texts of a work” (36). At the same time, critics, he argues, do and should take into account the material and social nature of the “living work” in their readings; and this includes both those that shape the initial production of the text and those that mediate each iteration of in the life of the work in the form of discrete editions of their text. Moreover, in this model critics’ readings (and any readings) contribute to the aggregation of the “work” as they influence future readings and shape and inform the creation of new “texts” in the life of the work (much like this edition).</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>This edition, then, takes as it's “argument” the position that there is unearthed meaning in the variations that we as readers and critics need to not only recognize but actively engage with during the act of reading and interpretation. The "Fluid Text Edition" of Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" makes visible its growth, multiple variants (each stage), as well as the different hands and processes that participate in literary production; the way written texts also “are always evolutionary in their shifting forms” as they, and their meanings, vary and shift as they are “redesigned and reprinted” and also “realised by successive readerships.” I am under no illusion that this text is not a “representation” inflected by my editorial and critical positions, which are themselves shaped by the readings of my antecedents. As Eggert notes: “To edit is to mediate, to come between. Documents are not self-declaring and may contain all kinds of impediments to their consumption” (82). And, indeed, the present edition mediates a number of “texts”—by Wilde, about Wilde, and about literary texts in general—to capture a moment of the “life” of this work. However, in crafting this editorial argument, the edition breaks away from conventional attempts “at establishing the texts of works as intended by their authors” by representing the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>fluidity</i> of the text and in turn making visible these (re)mediating forces. Additionally, by providing a dynamic representation of the text’s fluid life, the present edition places the reader in a more authoritative (and authorial) position as interpreter and crafter of textual meaning—an active contributor to the work—while also calling to readers’ attention that they themselves “are not neutral intermediaries but active mediators of the literary work” (Eggert 15).</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Moreover, this edition contends that endeavoring to render legible the essay as a fluid text helps readers more easily approach and interpret the “meanings laden” and latent, “in the material forms of the text.” (Eggert 3). The methodology for assembling the present edition, with this goal in mind, is therefore more closely aligned with the “German historical-critical editions,” than the methods “associated with James Thorpe in the United States and Philip Gaskell in England” for the creation of an “ideal” or “authoritative” critical edition “employing copy-texts drawn from a first or a later edition extensively revised by the author” (45-6). The employed editorial approach leverages the affordances of a digital apparatus to enable and promote access and comparison across variants, recognize the material contexts of production, consumption, and mediation. As Elena Pierazzo points out, a digital environment makes “possible the provision of texts in versions and texts as versions in a way that is much simpler, more intuitive and dynamic than corresponding print attempts” (49).  Moreover, she asserts, there is resonance between digital and textual “mutability,” as the digital environment, like the texts a digital edition represents, are also “inherently variable” in multiple aspects—from regular updates, variable user-interfaces, “the possibility of displaying the same text in different ways,” and even the dynamic navigation between versions enabled by hypertextuality (58, 50-52). So rather than “the detection and correction” of what Peter Shillingsburg calls the “infelicities in transmission”—the “noise” or “debris of transmission” that enters in to any type of communication “by the fact that the code of the sender never coincide” and “the medium imposes certain changes”—Pierazzo advocates for representing these “infelicities” (47). This edition does so but is not merely a digital archive documenting these variations. Instead, I contend, it is an edition that, through archival and book history informed editorial decisions in conjunction with this critical introduction and critical, scholarly commentary to the reading text, attempts to help readers realize the confluence of social, political, cultural and material forces that make themselves known through the life and fluidity of the text. While Eggert takes issue with scholars like Frank Moretti and Matthew Jockers on the contention that in the distant reading of metadata/digital texts "their datasets miss most historical connections between literary works” and exclude “contexts of reading and production” (13), this digital edition attempts to bring these in historical, material, cultural contexts to the fore, and study-able with computational methods, through a restricted dataset representing the work as presented and produced (by readers, editors, etc.) in its initial drafting and three publications.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>What is rendered legible, then, is how the text “lived” and was “produced” in the contexts of the decadent movement, and the forces these contexts exert on the text which surface in its fluidity (and what remains “solid”). The Fluid text edition “The Decay of Lying” thus demonstrates how “meanings and therefore works were always in process as the network of participants in the work’s trajectory through a culture or cultures across time gave it an ongoing existence: or, what we later came to call a life” (15). And taking Pierazzo’s philosophy one step further, the Fluid Text Edition of “The Decay of Lying” promotes inquiring into the meaning that can be gleaned from the communicative detritus that emerges in any act of (re)mediation and communication. <br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>In essence, this edition poses and opens up questions about:
</p><ul data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>What can we learn about the transmission of ideas, and the innumerable socio-cultural and political forces that impinge upon this transmission, by studying the “noise” of variant works? </li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>What might we learn about the nature of literature as a medium by studying the variability of the textual medium, the mediation of thought in language, and its various remediations? </li> <li data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>How might these aesthetic/literary considerations furnish new critical insights about works/texts, like “The Decay of Lying,” that take literary and aesthetic theoretical concerns as their objects of contemplation and the subject that is mediated? </li> </ul>
The present edition hopes to not only represent the meaning in the “debris,” but accentuate it, study it, and enable critical and scholarly engagement with it. <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>John Bryant asserts “the notion of textual fluidity is compatible with current critical approaches” (12), as he argues that “the history of textual versions can be seen as an enactment of deconstruction” with “material versions” and revisions materializing “from the moment of genesis and on into print, a constant deferral of the literary work itself” and that “analysis of textual fluidity—writing, revision, and versions—help us historicize the cultural functionality of creative process: the insertions of self into discourse, the modes of revision, the interdependency of writer and culture” (10, 12). And this critical compatibility extends to (and is accentuated by) the analytical tools that the digital age and computational methods afford, despite the assertions scholars like Eggert and Pierazzo arguing that Computational Literary Studies (CLS) flatten the fluid, material, and social conditions of the text and presuppose a single, stable text. While admitting that her claim is a “crude generalization,” Pierazzo states “that most data mining, distant reading and NLP methods assume texts to be stable, uncontroversial entities” and that “moving away from the one-text paradigm may have consequences. . .[for] Corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, stylometry, authorship attribution, data mining and many other scholarly disciplines and methodologies that approach texts from a quantitative point of view are based on the assumption that we can query the one text, and that not only does the one text exist, but also that we know what it is” (56). However, recent work has demonstrated the rich possibilities of combining CLS with approaches that foreground the multifariousness and plurality of the text (e.g. Hurst and Ohge, <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Textual Cultures</i> forthcoming Spring 2026). And by encoding this edition in eXtensible Markup Language or XML (see <a href="#using-the-edition" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“Using the Edition”</a> below), the fluid text edition of “The Decay of Lying” attempts to create a version of the text that accessible to modes of critical inquiry that leverage the affordances of computational and distant reading methods for a historically and materially sensitive reading. Indeed, a close or what Robin Valenza calls "slow" reading alongside data analysis and computational methods can be coordinated and complimentary in ways that can yield new insights about the text, whether through the uncovering of hitherto unidentified or neglected evidence or new readings that the defamiliarized reading perspective engenders. One goal of this edition is to illustrate that although digital humanities, digital editions, and CLS may not be capable of making the material literally more <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>tangible</i>, they can make the materiality of the text, and the theoretical significance of a fluid, polyphonic, and multivalent “living work,” more <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>present</i>. Though the digital humanities and book history may seem like polar ends on the spectrum of literary studies, aside from digital archives and metadata, projects like The Fluid Text Edition of “The Decay of Lying” showcase how their critical interests, methods, and aims often overlap and coincide. </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>To summarize, this edition attempts to represent Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" in its initial variants with the goal of enabling readers to view and investigate, through its material forms the hermeneutic significance of text's variability. The variations are themselves utterances shifting a text’s meaning that may signal inflections of larger social, cultural, or political forces legible in the fluidity of the text’s language. At the same time, I draw on the great scholarship of Bristow and Mitchell, who situate Wilde's printed version and the manuscript in conversation with his notebooks and extensive reading, helping to elucidate what Dirk Van Hulle terms a "creative ecology": "a web of intertextual and intratextual relations” that includes drafts, notebooks, marginalia, and published variants, “present[ing] the oeuvre not just as a set of works, but as a Gestalt, as something that is not just more than the sum of its parts, but also different from the sum of its parts” (40, 48). To highlight this network of creative activity, which includes both reading and writing, the fluid text edition promotes users “to read across versions” in a fashion that highlights “the relations between them” and beyond them. To illuminate some of the unseen connections, the edition brings together the excellent commentary and notes of previous Wilde editors Josephine Guy, Horst Schroeder, and Joseph Brisow and Rebecca N. Mitchell alongside my own commentary on the variations present across the earliest extant versions (38). Moreover, as discussed in the analytical introduction below, I attempt to highlight moments of what Van Hulle has called "creative concurrence": the moments of textual and conceptual similarity that emerge across discrete "works" but are a part of the same temporally confined creative activity. Some exemplary instances are discussed below, including those that spotlight the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>material</i> component of "creative concurrence" as concepts physically and conceptually move across texts, sometimes even bleeding through the page to become palimpsestically visible. However, these are not mere moments of practical and/or self-conscious "Self-Plagiarism" (Guy). They illustrate a creative repurposing and re-envisioning of the same literary material in new physical, temporal, and social moments that constitute self-reflexive versions of what John Bryant calls "adaptive revision." Indeed, beyond the external social and cultural forces that become legible through the text and its variants, the internalization and interpretation of these forces and one's own contributions to the milieu or discourse that comprise these larger cultural sentiments are expressed through both revisions and what is left unrevised. And the reader of these texts is both implicated and imbricated in any expression of textual meaning too.</p> <h3 id="using-the-edition" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Using the Edition <a href="#using-the-edition" class="anchor" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>🔗</a></h3> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>

The first will investigate the essay’s material conditions and the ways this materiality inflects and/or reflects its concepts. The second study will demonstrate how the encoded XML can be utilized for CLS analyses of the fluid text.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Material (A)symmetry: Art, Nature, and The Mirror</b></p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>In an essay concerned with discussing and inverting the relationships between Originality and Imitation, Art and Nature—or as phrased in a revised passage “Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself. She is not to be judged by any external standard of <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>perfection</s> <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>resemblance</b>. She is a veil, rather than a mirror.” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f032/f/f032/folio31_fluid/-1/g" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.31</a>)—it may come as no surprise that such mirroring, and problematizing of this mirroring, surfaces on and through the material MS as well. Indeed, I suggest, the aesthetic theory proffered in the essay, deeply concerned with the intangibility of individual subjectivity and the imagination, has, for Wilde, material foundations and implications for our understanding of the material word that are legible and reified in the material conditions of inscription.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>A key contention of Vivian’s “article” recited in the dialogue is that Art supersedes, precedes, and contains exceeds nature (see Danson, Green, Riquelme, Small, and Sussman). In Vivian’s schema (and Wilde’s if we take Vivian as a mouthpiece), Art is not to be reduced to a mirror of nature, but rather, at its pinnacle Art inverts the conventional art-nature mirror relationship. Motifs of reflection and representation (of mirroring) by art, the “self-conscious” artist, life, and nature are both the rhetorical crux and general thesis of many of the essay’s critical assertions. Moreover, the art-nature mirror dynamic that predominates the conceptual focus of the text are reified and reflected in the material condition of the MS, tangibly mirroring or echoing the aesthetic concerns of the dialogue on the very pages they were inscribed. For example, on <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f018/f/f018/folio17_fluid/-1/g?zone=%23f055_z001" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.17</a>, Wilde wrote for Vivian:</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The public<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>imagine that, because they are interested<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>in their immediate surroundings,  Art<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should</i> be interested in them also, and<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should</i> take them as her subject-<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>matter. But the mere fact that they<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>are interested in these things makes<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>them unsuitable subjects for Art.</blockquote> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oi9N9FX.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;" alt="f.17 of The Decay of Lying" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p style="text-align: center;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Figure 1. f.17 of “The Decay of Lying,” University of Akron: Herman Muehlstein Rare Book Collection. PR5818.d43 1889</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>In a critique of the popular sense of what Art <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should</i> do—that art’s “interest” and “subject-matter” <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should</i> mirror the interest of “the public” and their “immediate-surroundings” in its content—Wilde, creating a semantic redundancy for emphasis, reiterates the word “should.” But he does so by stacking the terms, one on top of the other, literally mirroring them over the line break. While in any printed edition the repetition works to drive home to reiterative nature of such Art, in the MS this emphasis is materially amplified. The conceptual discussion of art as a mirroring representation of public “interest” and life is materially re-instantiated and reinscribed, materially mirrored, in the very construction of the sentence.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>While such moments occur sporadically in the MS,<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-3" id="ref-note-3" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>3</a></sup> the dynamic mirroring motif—Wilde’s complication of the relationship between art as representation of nature and/or life—arises in its most exemplary material instantiation on <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f031/f/f031/folio30_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.30</a>. On this folio Wilde wrote:</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>To excuse themselves<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>they will try and shelter under the<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>shield of him who made Prospero<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the magician, and gave him Caliban<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>and Ariel to serve him as his servants, who<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>heard the Tritons blowing their horns<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>round the coral reefs of the Enchanted<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Isle.</blockquote> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The mirroring here is even less visible to the reader of any single reading-text edtion, or even the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> manuscript, than the line break symmetry above. As Josephine Guy reported in 2014, the back of f19 of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Berg </i> MS is a fair-copy of a review for Wyke Bayliss’s The Enchanted Isle (titled “The New President” and is quite critical), which came out the same month as “Decay of Lying.” Both sides carry allusions/direct references to Shakespeare’s <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Tempest</i>, forming the basis for her argument that Wilde’s notorious “Self-Plagiarism[s]” may actually be a result of complex drafting process where multiple drafts of the same and different pieces were being composed simultaneously. While this may not explain away extensive reusing&#x27;s of whole passages (like the discussion of Balzac on <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f017/f/f017/folio16_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.16</a> that is almost entirely lifted from his review published a few years prior), it does suggest an interestingly recursive composition process; a drafting process that would account for the initial reference to Caliban above that was replaced in the 1891 variant. This coinciding of material and textual mirroring physically instantiates the motif, with mirroring allusion on opposite sides of the same material. But in its existence, it complicates the art-nature relationship. Here, it is art that mirrors art, creating a materially and textually self-reflexive literature. Moreover, even when the mirroring effect is physically displaced and obscured through inscription and printing across different materials, its nature as texts gives the mirror, and art as what is mirrored, a temporal permanence that, in Wildes view (as discussed below), stifles endeavors to render art the mirror of life. </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>And beyond purely documentary features, what has gone unexplored is how the latter portion of this short piece alludes to ideas about the role and purpose of art, quintessentially decadent notions, that Wilde teases out in “The Decay of Lying.” For example, Wilde remarks that:</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the pictures of contemporary events, Royal marriages naval reviews and things of this kind, that appear in the Academy every year, are always extremely bad, while the very same subjects treated in black and white in the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Graphic</i> or the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>London News</i> are excellent. Besides if we want to understand the history of a nation <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>through the medium of art</b> <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go, and not to the arts that are definitely imitative. The visible aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of life’s spirit. Probably it never did contain </i>(3:3).</blockquote> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The review (and many of his reviews Green argues) conceptually mirror the ideas that “true” art emerges from the “imaginative,” i.e., “lying,” and linguistically overlaps with the revised assertion on f.43 and f.44: “The more abstract, the more ideal an art is, the more it reveals to us the temper of its age. If we wish to understand a nation <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>by means of its art, </b> let us look at its architecture <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>and</s> <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>or</b> its music.” What’s more, the idea of an “imaginative” realism echoes his praise of Balzac in both his review of <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Lost Illusions</i>, and, in repurposed fashion, in the “Decay of Lying” (delivered via a critique of Zola). Such an example of conceptual resonances nicely exemplifies Van Hulle’s notion of “creative concurrence” and helps us understand the work as always becoming and inherently “social”—in conversation with others and with our past ideas. </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Wilde’s writing in this recursive and reiterative fashion, in which he lifts and recontextualizes whole passages, may be a self-reflexive form of the type of “creative synthesis” (Bristow and Mitchell) or “absorption” and “communication with style” (Schiff) that enacts the aesthetic theory Schiff reads in the essay (or a necessity when writing so prolifically). It is not “imitative” but a creative material and conceptual self-reflexivity, creating something new out of the same refashioned material/constitutive parts. Moreover, it demonstrates that textual fluidity is not bound to or by a single work-concept. It extends, as Van Hulle shows, throughout (and even outside, Bryant might argue) a whole <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>oeuvre</i>—moving across discrete “texts” but surfacing on (or through) the same material—materially reifying “creative concurrence.” Ideas are articulated, rearticulated, reimagined amidst new contexts, even if the words are largely the same.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> Indeed, the mirroring of art in art, from one side of the material text to another, remains legible across materials and frames the subsequent expressions and our interactions with art objects. The material mirroring of content goes beyond a figurative bleeding through, but erupts in content of the passage that follows as Wilde complicates the Art-Nature mirroring dynamic in his reading and interpretation of Shakespeare:</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>They will call upon Shakespeare—<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>they always do—and will quote that<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>hackneyed passage about Art holding<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the mirror up to Nature, forgetting that<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>this unfortunate aphorism is deliberately<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>said by Hamlet in order to convince<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the bystanders of his absolute<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>insanity in all art matters (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f031/f/f031/folio30_fluid/-1/g" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.31</a>)</blockquote> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>And it is perhaps no coincidence that on the following folio of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS, Vivian declares that Art “is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f032/f/f032/folio31_fluid/-1/g" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.31</a>). The materiality of Wilde’s “self-plagiarisms” converse with the essay’s aesthetic principles to both articulate and demonstrate an aesthetic schema, in which Art does not (re)mediate nature. Rather, “the medium of art” is a structure and structuring force, creating and acting as the framework for understanding our impressions and perceptions of nature (Schiff 90). Our encounters with art create the structure of “beauty” that then frames our perceptions and aesthetic judgements of nature, which are in turn, according to Kantian aesthetics, taken as inherent qualities of the object (nature) itself (what Kant terms “subreption”). And it is this understanding of art that Vivian proffers when he asserts, that art “is a veil, rather than a mirror.” Art does not reflect beauty in nature but creates the images that we take for a mirror (in ways we do not even recognize). Hence, too, why “The more abstract, the more ideal an art is, the more it reveals to us the temper of its age” and that great art anticipates life (f.43). Finally, this dynamic becomes visible, as Wilde’s essay demonstrates, in moments of artistic self-reflexivity (mirroring) and the conceptual and material (a)symmetry that arises. Our own subjective positions, and the way art and subjectivity inflect what we assume to be objective, are hyper-legible when art physically and conceptually structures and mirrors itself.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Of course, in Wildean and decadent fashion, Vivian’s seemingly paradoxical aesthetic schema does not remain unproblematic nor straightforward. In the MS and <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Nineteenth Century</i> variants, Wilde would go on to reference Caliban once more, but ultimately revised out the allusion for the 1891 publication:</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“his work is entirely wrong<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>from beginning to end, and wrong<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>not on the ground of morals, but on<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the ground of Art. From any ethical<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>standpoint it is just what it<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should be. The author is perfectly truthful, and<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>describes things exactly as they happen.<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>What more can any moralist desire?<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>We have no sympathy at all with<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the moral indignation of our time against<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>M. Zola. It is simply the rage indignation of</blockquote> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Tartuffe on being exposed <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Caliban on seeing his own face in a<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>glass</s>(<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f013/f/f013/folio12_fluid/-1/g" target="_blank" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.12</a>)</blockquote> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Wilde changes the allusion from <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Tempest</i> to Molière’s <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Le Tartuff</i> when revising for <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Intentions</i>. Guy notes that “In <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>De Profundis</i> and a cancelled draft of <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>A Woman of No Importance</i> Wilde cites both characters as interchangeable,” yet, here at least, Caliban’s anger emerges out of self-reflection, a literal looking into the mirror, whereas Tartuffe is exposed by others. One is firmly grounded in an inward-looking act, while the other external. In the dichotomy the essay has crafted, art <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>should</i> expose the self, holding up a mirror to the individuality of subjective experience in an act of self-reflexive, creative “lying” in contrast to an externally focused, mimetic (in someways, Wilde argues, more imitative and deceptive) realism (see Schiff 87). So, while the material allusions are mirrored across discrete texts with shared materials, over the course of the work's life the mirroring allusions are ultimately erased by the texts fluidity (You cannot step into the same river twice, so to speak), further complicating the art-nature mirroring relationship.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Defining, Refining, Amplifying the Criticism: Mapping Additions, Deletions, and Sentiment</b></p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Parsing the text by stage using the encoded XML allows for visualization of any version of the text, as well as analysis of words added and deleted.

For instance, “art of a country” was struck for “culture of a country,” while inscribing the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS, or when Art and Life become confused during the act of crafting the art-nature mirror dynamic discussed above. This happens twice in the MS; once on <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f035/f/f035/folio34_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.34</a>: “They knew that <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Art</s> <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Life</b> gains from <s data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Life</s> <b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Art</b>” (Figure 2) and the again when Wilde explicitly invokes the relationship: “Art Life holds the mirror up to Art,” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f042/f/f042/folio41_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.41</a>).</p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/muE5uNM.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;" alt="f.34 of The Decay of Lying" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p style="text-align: center;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Figure 2. <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f035/f/f035/folio34_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.34</a> of “The Decay of Lying,” University of Akron: Herman Muehlstein Rare Book Collection. PR5818.d43 1889</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Although a number of these moments see a reinsertion of the term in the immediate vicinity, the frequent deletions of “art,” especially during StBa (revisions to the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> text), indicate a significant reworking of those portions of the essay engaging directly with “art.” While the initial inclination would be to suggest that this is a product of “art” being one of the most frequently appearing words in the text, this logic notably does not hold for the other high frequency terms like “nature.” Rather, “nature” was the most frequently added word, especially for those incorporated during Stage D (for the 1891 edition), with 16 additions. This contrast increased the ratio of words like “nature” and “life” in proportion to references to “art” over the course of the “life” of the work. </p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Closer inspection of the 16 additions of nature in Stage D shows that 11 of these instances arise in extended passage on Impressionist Art, in which Vivian asserts that it is “Impressionists” who give us the “effect” of Nature, rather than Nature providing the form for the effect of the impressionists. The contention in his aesthetic philosophy that art gives form to our perception of nature, as discussed above, is one that received extensive elaboration over the course of his revisions. Not only does he make this apparent the wholly new passage on the Impressionists, but elsewhere, adding that “The only effects that she can show us are effects that we have already seen through poetry, or in paintings. This is the secret of Nature&#x27;s charm, as well as the explanation of Nature&#x27;s weakness” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f042/f/f042/folio41_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.41</a>) and</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will not behave like a tourist and go to Tokio. On the contrary, you will stay at home, and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists, and then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught their imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in the Park, or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely Japanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere. (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f046/f/f046/folio45_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.45</a>)</blockquote> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Wilde is clearly concerned with the distinction between nature and art and, like his removal of explicit invocation of “art,” systematically eliminates any moments when they become conflated. For example, on <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f032/f/f032/folio31_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.31</a>, “botanist” is replaced for “forests” and “museum” for woodland, further solidifying the natural imagery, while in the MS, “perfection” is replaced for “resemblance.”<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-4" id="ref-note-4" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>4</a></sup> These efforts suggest that Wilde’s aesthetics are specifically an attack on mimetic Art, an attempt to recapture nature in art. This desire manifests in his elimination of references to “photographs” at sequential stages. At Stage D, he eliminates the reference to the “a photograph of a Japanese gentleman or lady,” leaving only “beside a real Japanese gentleman or lady,” which, in turn, eliminates the sense that photography (as an art) is a representation or an approximation of nature or life. It also removes the possibility that the Realist and Naturalist Arts he takes issue with in the essay is actually a self-reflexive remediation of art, as opposed to a mimetic project. Instead, as a passage from the Berg MS that was not included in the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS suggests, Wilde considered photography and Naturalism to be (erringly) striving after the same mimetic ends: “Realism and abandoning the wicked tents of those peripatetic photographers who call them-selves Naturalistic novelists” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f030/f/f030/folio29_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.29</a>). Indeed, the seemingly increased precision with which Wilde delineates the type of Art he is critiquing extends to his meaning of lying. Realism, in its mimetic but fictional efforts, is “lying with a moral purpose,” an attempt to replicate Life in fiction, which, with its deceitful intentions (hence, the revision to Odysseus’s “<i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>sly</i> words of devising” <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f051/f/f051/folio49_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.49</a>), betrays an attempt to recreate or achieve something, rather than: “the only form of Lying that is absolutely beyond reproach is Lying for its own sake, and the highest development of this is, as we have already pointed out, Lying in Art.” Again pointing towards the self-reflexivity discussed above, Wilde’s three additions of “self-conscious”—sixty percent of its five total occurrences—emphasize that the highest form of art should be a “<i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>self-conscious creation</i>” and not any sort of deluded attempt replicate, remediate, or <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>re</i>present.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The “effect” of these revisions (and Wilde was increasingly preoccupied with “effects”,—perhaps the structuring effects of art—quadrupling its frequency from 3 to 13 between 1889 and 1891) in the end, is an increasingly harsh critique of Realism, mimetic art, and Nature in a fashion that amplifies the two prongs of Wilde’s theory of art, as Hilda Schiff describes them: that “we degrade art by asking it to follow nature” and that “good art not only does not follow nature, but nature often appears to mirror art. Believing that things exist only in so far as they are perceived, man&#x27;s perceptions, when loaded with art-images, project upon nature an existence imitative of art” (90). While the latter is articulated in the MS draft in passages like the concluding lines of <a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f055/f/f055/folio53_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.53</a>: “The third doctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life. This results not merely from Life&#x27;s imitative instinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realize that energy” and in several revisions, like the Stage D addition just prior to this assertion: “Life goes faster than Realism, but Romanticism is always in front of Life” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f055/f/f055/folio53_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.53</a>) and the above additions that make the claim explicit (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f055/f/f055/folio53_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.53</a>).</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>However, the former of Schiff’s assertions, and the volatility of “degradation” as opposed to err or fail, might be valuably explored through a form of computational literary studies: sentiment analysis.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>A form of Natural Language Procession (NLP), sentiment analysis is a type of text classification which categorizes the words in a text or texts by emotion and sentiment, and in some algorithms assigns a quantitative value according to its emotional valence.<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-5" id="ref-note-5" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>5</a></sup> When calculating the sentiment of a corpus, “sentiment analysis maps specific words [also referred to as tokens] to specific sentiment values. These values, which are looked up in a sentiment dictionary (or “lexicon”), range from positive to negative according to the specific design of the dictionary” (Jockers 160).  But since in sentiment analysis “the focus is turned away from the actual [content], and more toward the author’s presentation or organization” of the text, joining this analysis with encoded revisions enables investigation into the shifts in the kinds of textual presentation, the style and tone of the language introduced, removed, and reworked (Jockers 160).<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-6" id="ref-note-6" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>6</a></sup> This unconventional method of literary research can reveal hitherto overlooked dynamics and, even when it fails to accurately capture the nuances of language, highlights textual complexities that can be analyzed through close reading. By situating scholars in a defamiliarized position to the textual condition, sentiment analysis and other CLS methods can bring to the fore the rich intricacies at the syntactical and even lexical level. By offering a methodology for studying textual fluidity within the context of creative ecologies and concurrence, such approaches promise to raise important new questions and insights into the complex relationship between material reading practices and composition.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Considering Wilde’s characteristic affectation, alongside the essay’s aesthetic preoccupation with effect, presentation, impression, and <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>art</i>ifice, sentiment analysis’s measuring the emotional volatility of language positions it as a form of CLS particularly well-suited, if also counter-intuitive, for exploring the semantic effect of the fluid variations of “The Decay of Lying.” It offers in its calculations a way of (not infallibly) measuring the effect of the changes to presentation, throwing into stark relief how even the most minute alterations in diction can drastically alter the impression of the text, even if not its “substance.” Additionally, the aesthetes’ contention that
</p><blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>the writer's aim, consciously or unconsciously, comes to be the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>transcribing,</i> not of the world, not of mere fact, but of his sense of it, he becomes an artist, his work fine art; and good art in proportion to the truth of his presentment of that sense. . . The transcript of his sense of fact rather than the fact, as being preferable, pleasanter, more beautiful to the writer himself</blockquote>
prizes the artists’ <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>subjective</i> sense of truth. This deeply personal and variable understanding of impersonality, “this transcript of fact. . .in its <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>infinite variety</i>, modified by human preference in all its infinitely varied forms,” interestingly complicates sentiment analysis’s ostensibly “objective” quantitative measures of sentiment or “effect” (Pater 9-11, emphasis added). Nonetheless, the aesthetes’ attention to precision in “translat[ing] from inward to outward. . .some personal sense of fact” is chiefly preoccupied with the minuteness of expression and the most subtle nuances of language (34), since “all beauty is in the long run only fineness of truth, or <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>what we call expression, the finer accommodation of speech to that vision within</i>” (10, emphasis added), is similarly brought to the fore and centered as the object of inquiry in sentiment analysis. The methodology, aims, and even fallibility of sentiment analysis suggest that as a <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>complementary</i> method for studying the aesthetic theories (and the self-reflexive praxis of those theories in crictal essays), it may prove valuable in orienting an insightful critical inquiry. Indeed, through sentiment analysis, in both the passages and words it calls attention to, and in the moments where it clearly fails, highlights the aesthetes’ belief “that every language possesses a genius, a very fastidious genius, of its own” (15). And sentiment analysis, in prompting new and reoriented close readings through the results it returns, its empirical and quantitative relationship to the text, and how both situates scholars in defamiliarized position, can aid in generating new research questions and avenues into the text, especially those like Wilde’s dealing primarily themselves the ambiguity and volatility of literary theory and movements.  <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>When performing a sentiment analysis on both 1889 and 1891 variants, and tracking how that changes over the course of the text, a clear divergence emerges at what was once the nadir of the 1889 periodical version (Figure 3).  The low point in the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Nineteenth Century</i> variant is the Vivian’s recounting of the “Hyde” like incident, upon revision, with extremely “negative” words like “horror,” “terror,” “frightened,” “scream” and “rough people” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f038/f/f038/folio37_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.37</a>).<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-7" id="ref-note-7" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>7</a></sup> However, upon revision, Wilde flattens the emotional volatility of the scene by adding “well-written” and “humanitarian,” and through the inclusion of more positive language in the paragraph that follows (words like “beauty,” “great,” and “friend”).</p> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VNP21m0.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;" alt="Plot of Rolling Mean of Syuzhet Sentiment Analysis Scores of 1889 and 1891 editions" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <p style="text-align: center;" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Figure 3. Plot of Rolling Mean of Syuzhet Sentiment Analysis Scores of 1889 and 1891 editions.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>However, in <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Intentions</i>, there is a precipitous fall, about 75% of the way through the essay, that’s not present in the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Nineteenth Century</i> variant. This is a result of the insertion of the extensive passage deriding the Nature as a derivative of Art, and lambasting any who turn idolize Nature. the “degradation” that Schiff associates with part of Wilde’s aesthetic principle becomes measurably apparent in the cluster of the second half of the added passage rife with “negative” language, which becomes the most negative point of the second half of the essay; passages, like  “It was simply a very second-rate Turner, a Turner of a bad period, with all the painter&#x27;s worst faults exaggerated and over-emphasized,” “She produces her false Renés and her sham Vautrins, just as Nature gives us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp, and on another a more than questionable Rousseau. Still, Nature irritates one more when she does things of that kind. It seems so stupid, so obvious, so unnecessary.” and “A doubtful Cuyp is unbearable” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f042/f/f042/folio41_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.41</a>). This added passage typifies a tendency for revisions to increase the “negative” presentation of Wilde’s criticisms and to redirect/redeploy the “negative” sentiments in his text. For instance, Wilde inserts” replaces “healthy national feeling” with “solemn depressing truths” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f026/f/f026/folio25_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.25</a>), “allowed” for “suffered” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f024/f/f024/folio23_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.23</a>), “bad” for “depressing” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f019/f/f019/folio18_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.18</a>), “After all,” for “It is a humiliating confession” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f014/f/f014/folio13_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.13</a>),<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-8" id="ref-note-8" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>8</a></sup> and “probable” for “tedious” (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f049/f/f049/folio48a_fluid/-1/g" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.48</a>; Table 1).

While there are, of course, sporadic instances in which “positive” language is added in revisions, like his added praise of the art that life imitates: Stevenson’s “well-written” story,<sup data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><a href="#note-10" id="ref-note-10" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>10</a></sup> these also work to lower the negative “sentiment” in passages that align with Vivian’s principles (here, Stevenson’s story prefigures and anticipates “life”—or “it should”).</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Sentiment analysis of revisions, in calling attention to how the presentation of the interlocuters' discussion changes (for example, Cyril’s “Is that the end of this dangerous the article” is changed to “I like it. Is that the end?”). And, on the whole, the quantitative results point to key revisions to magnify or add negative language to sharpen the essay’s critique while homing in on the type of art it targets, like the criticisms of Hall Caine, James Payn, and William Black added to the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Intentions</i> version of the essay (<a href="https://brandonhurst01.github.io/The-Decay-of-Lying-2025/#/ec/f011/f/f011/folio10_intentions1891/-1/g?zone=%23f055_z001" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>f.10</a>). Calculating the average sentiment score for each sentence of the 1889 and 1891 variants, indicates that the later variant has on average more “negatively” connotated language, reflecting the honing hostility of the essay’s rhetoric across variants that can be observed in individual isolations. And, mirroring the refinement of diction that clarifies the type of art to be praised, and the type to be critiqued, the revised criticisms are not only amplified in their emotional valence, but they are also specified to narrow and more precisely defines the “imitative arts” it critiques. Thus, in a very Wildean and Paterian fashion, sentiment analysis suggests that across the fluid, living texts, the characteristics of the linguistic <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>presentation</i>, the subject, and the concepts of the argument increasingly align: “The term is right, and has its essential beauty, when it becomes, in a manner, what it signifies, as with the names of simple sensations” (22).</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <thead data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <th data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Replaced Phrase</th> <th data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Sentiment Score</th> <th data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Added Phrase</th> <th data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Sentiment Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>healthy national feeling</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>1.00</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>solemn depressing truths</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-1.25</td> </tr> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>allowed</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>0.00</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>suffered</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-1.00</td> </tr> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>bad</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-0.75</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>depressing</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-1.00</td> </tr> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>After all</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>0.00</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>It is a humiliating confession</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-1.25</td> </tr> <tr data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>probable</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>0.00</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>tedious</td> <td data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>-0.50</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <h3 id="notes" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Notes <a href="#notes" class="anchor" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>🔗</a></h3> <p id="note-1" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <a href="#ref-note-1" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>1.</a>
Bristow and Mitchell document the string of sales as follows: “Stuart Mason [Christopher Sclater Millard] recorded its sale at Sotheby’s for 111 on July 26, 1910” after it had been given by Wilde to “Mr Frank Richardson” (see also Stuart Mason [Christopher Millard], <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Bibliography of Oscar Wilde</i> (London, 1914), 123). They then note that “In 1920, an ‘original manuscript of ‘‘The Decay of Lying’’, written on fifty-five pages folio’ was purchased by distinguished rare book collector Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach for $1,525. It later appeared in the Rosenbach Company’s 1933 sale catalogue, listed at $3,400. The manuscript reappeared in 1937, when, during a recession that halted the post-Depression recovery, the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>New York Times</i> recorded ‘an autograph manuscript of Oscar Wilde’s ‘‘The Decay of Lying’’, containing about 12,500 words, went to Retz &amp; Storm for $975’ at an auction at the American Art Association’s Anderson Galleries.” How it “became part of the collection of rubber magnate Herman Muehlstein” is not reported, but “in 1957, the University of Akron awarded Muehlstein, President of H. Muehlstein and Co., dealers of plastics and rubber, an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. Two years earlier, Muehlstein had donated a first round of items from his rare book collection to the university and pledged to donate the remainder upon his death. In 1962, the remainder of the bequest, including the fair copy of Wilde’s ‘The Decay of Lying’, entered Akron’s collection.” (573–74).

For example, Wilde similar deploys, but inverts, the material mirroring over the line break to level a critique. On f.48b, Wilde inscribed:<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> </p><blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>

not in proper through his capacity for<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
belief, but through his capacity for<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
disbelief.
</blockquote>
The very asymmetry between the Church’s practice and doctrine is itself mirrored as “belief” and “disbelief” are mirrored over the line break. <br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
Likewise in his attack on the “English melodrama,” this line break mirroring appears once more, but this time to criticize a an erroneous or ill-advised mirroring of dialogue “on” and “off” the stage:<br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r> <blockquote data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>

The problematic of the melodrama taking “directly from life and reproduce[ing] its vulgarity down to the smallest detail” is materially reflected and instantiated in the inscription on the page.

The NRC lexicon has 8 basic emotions in which a word can be categorized, as well as “positive” or “negative” association. "The Bing lexicon[4] has a binary categorization, which simply has two values of –1 and 1. The Afinn lexicon [5] grades words between –5 and 5. The Syuzhet lexicon has more specific values for each sentiment word, ranging between –1 and 1, which are –1.0, –0.8 –0.75, –0.6, –0.5, –0.4, –0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 0.8, 1.0.” (Kim 2). The present analysis uses the Syuzhet lexicon, developed by the Nebraska Literary Lab under the direction of Matthew Jockers, and draws upon the work of computational linguists at The Stanford NLP Group (Jockers 161).

In a fascinating removal in the MS, Wilde cuts “looking” from “rough looking people” turning a subjective perception into an aesthetic judgment that assumes the subjective perception of “rough” is an inherent quality of the object “people.” This single cut collapses the distinction between perception, informed by Art (here, Stevenson’s story), and the “fact” or “truth” of reality.

Much of the added “positive” language tends to rephrase other “positive” terms; e.g., “exquisite” for “deightful” (f.9), “admirable and thoughtful” for “excellent philosophical” (f.49), and “happy” for “joyous” (f.51)
