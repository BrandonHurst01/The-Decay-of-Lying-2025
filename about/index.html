However, in 2012, the fair copy manuscript resurfaced when University of Akron’s University Archivist S. Victor Fleischer added it to the library’s digital catalogue (PR5818.d43 1889). Joseph Bristow and Rebecca N. Mitchell, who reported the finding in a 2014 <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Notes and Queries</i> publication and crafted a subsequent print-transcription of the manuscript with an illuminating accompanying introductory essay, state that the manuscript (henceforth referred to as the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS) had actually been donated to the University of Akron in 1962 in the second of two rounds of donations to the University’s rare book collection by Herman Muehlstein (574). How the manuscript made its way into his private collection remains undocumented, but it remained “undisturbed” there until 2012.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>As Bristow and Mitchell document, “The absence of the manuscript from the scholarly record and from readers’ perusal means that it has survived in excellent condition, rebound in leather but otherwise untouched. Wilde’s text is written in black ink on fifty-five recto pages”: fifty-four numbered folios with pages labelled 48A and 48B. There are ink and pencil revisions in Wilde’s hand throughout the MS; pencil marks including brackets, strikethroughs, signatures, and punctuation corrections in the hand of multiple typesetters and sparse blue-pencil inscriptions likely by typesetters are also extant.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Thanks to the generosity of the University of Akron’s Herman Muehlstein Rare Book Collection, facisimile images of the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS were created in September of 2025. I then converted these images into IIIF format, allowing for zoning and encoding, and created the present edition which tracks the revisions not only to the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Akron</i> MS, enabling an easy reading of revisions alongside dynamic MS images (a uniquely digital affordance), but also includes versions tracking changes across the initial variants of the essay. Further detail about the viewing options can be found in the <a href="#using-the-edition" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“Using the Edition”</a> section below.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>In creating this edition, I follow the invaluable editorial and critical scholarship of Bristow and Mitchell who transcribed the manuscript with extensive (but not quite exhaustive) notes on variations between the MS and the 1889 publication as well as notable variations from content in the extant <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Berg</i> holograph. Like Bristow and Mitchell, the present edition is not designed “to supplant or supersede their account,” and I too draw upon both Horst Schroder’s and Josephine Guy’s “indispensable observations” about the essay (99). Indeed, the work of these four scholars heavily informed my editorial decisions when assembling the edition and were largely the basis of many of the explanatory notes to the reading text. This edition is meant to complement the astounding editorial work of these scholars by creating an edition that allows readers to engage directly with facsimile evidence and explore the untapped hermeneutical possibilities to be found by investigating the essay in its genesis and variations. My critical contribution based on close analysis of this edition will be expounded in the <a href="#analytical-introduction" data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>“Analytical Introduction”</a> below.</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r><b data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>A "Fluid Text" Edition:</b><br data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
The term "Fluid Text," “any literary work that exists in more than one version,” was introduced by John Bryant and taken up (under various nomenclature) by a number of digital scholars such as Paul Eggert, Dirk Van Hulle, and Elena Pierazzo. The fluid or "living-text" (Eggert) concept as a editorial and critical framework, theorizes a way of exploring the rich significance <em data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>in</em> what has previously been termed textual "instability." Bryant offers the fluid text concept and theory as a way of rethinking the “work-concept” and problematizes the idea of an “authoritative” or “fixed” version of any text, the predominant "one-text culture" (Pierazzo) or "single-text logic" (Van Hulle) of literary studies. As Bryant concisely states “all works—because of the nature a of texts and creativity—are fluid texts. . .it is inherent in the phenomena of writing itself. . .Literary works invariably exist in more than one version, either in early manuscript forms, subsequent print edition, or even adaptation. . .the processes of authorial, editorial, and cultural revision that create theses versions are inescapable” (1). Bryant rejects the disciplinary convention of assembling a single critical text, because, “the smoothness of the reading text, a hallmark of critical editing, in effect denies us an immediate awareness of the actual roughness of the textual record, and textuality itself” (27). Instead, Bryant’s reframes what has traditionally been called textual “instability” as a remarkably generative and rich potentiality for scholarship; whereas textual “instability” or “indeterminacy” casts the act of editing as an effort to solidify textual precarity, a “fluid” text and “textual fluidities” not only accounts for, but embraces as a hermeneutically significant the “flow of creativity” and the inherently social processes and inflections on the act of writing (as opposed to authorship) (5-6). He argues that the concept of the fluid-text makes room for the taking into account of intention as an utterance of broader socio-cultural movements. Situating his theory in conversation with Foucault and Derrida, Bryant argues, “a fluid text bodies forth concrete instances of an idiosyncratic individual negotiating idiosyncratically with an audience. Such idiosyncrasies cannot represent a cultural, but as a particularized instance of cultural engagement, the may be seen in their peculiarity as a concrete enactment of culture. . .they are a graphic manifestation of the discourses of self, word, and society” (9).The approach of this edition is meant to enable readers realize that texts are yes, authored, but also bound up in “the socialised circumstances that gave rise to it” (4). As such, this editions representations of Wilde's, and other agents, iterative reconfigurations of the essay can and should be read as creative/authorial choices, but also recognize the ways these choices are always inflected by and discursively engaged with broader literary, social, cultural, and political moments, movements, and ideologes. As Wilde (drawing on Pater) argues in the essay, Art frames and moulds our subjective impression and interpretation of experience, and in turn shapes and informs the art we create. And while he offers an aesthetic theory that attempts to counter this aesthetically reproductive cycle, his project (evidenced to his use of his own writings and his conceptual similarities to the work of some of his contemporaries as demonstrated by Bristow and Mitchell, Guy, and Schroder), like many artistic and literary efforts of the decadent writers and <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>fin-de-siècle</i> aesthetes, is an impossible achievement doomed to failure (even if the attempt is, in the scheme of things, generative).
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
In Paul Eggert's <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>The Work and the Reader in Literary Studies: Scholarly Editing and Book History</i>, he outlines the limitations of scholarly editing and the production of scholarly editions of texts, arguing for a living model that draws both upon the epistemologies of book history and literary critics for a semiotics and hermeneutics of editing. Eggert's model reads and re-presents texts as socially produced “living texts,” and claims that every edition must be an argument: “the texts of works never come down to us in unmediated form, every scholarly edition is necessarily an embodied argument about the text or texts of a work” (36). In re-presenting a text, the editor is making a claim about the text in the act of re-presenting it (a claim borne out and evidenced by the editorial choices). This edition, then, takes as it's “argument” the position that there is unearthed meaning in the variations that we as readers and critics need to not only recognize but actively engage with during the act of reading and interpretation. The "Fluid Text Edition" of Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" makes visible its growth, multiple variants (each stage), as well as the different hands and processes that participate in literary production; the way written texts also “are always evolutionary in their shifting forms” as they, and their meanings, vary and shift as they are “redesigned and reprinted” and also “realised by successive readerships.” In so doing,the edition breaks away from conventional attempts “at establishing the texts of works as intended by their authors” by endeavoring to render legible the essay as a fluid text, helping readers to more easily approach and interpret the “meanings laden” and latent, “in the material forms of the text.” (3).This approach, along with a critical introduction and editorial notes, will attempt to help readers realize that texts are yes, authored, but also bound up in “the socialised circumstances that gave rise to it” (4). While Eggert takes issue with scholars like Frank Morettin and Matthew Jockers on the contention that that distant reading of metadata/digital texts “ ‘their datasets miss most historical connections between literary works,’” and exclude  “contexts of reading and production” (13), this digital edition attempts through introduction and compiled commentary, does not attempt re-present the work as presented and produced (by readers, editors, etc.) beyond its initial drafting and three publications. Instead, what is re-presenting the text as it “lived” and was “produced” in the context of the decadent movement: “Meanings and therefore works were always in process as the network of participants in the work’s trajectory through a culture or cultures across time gave it an ongoing existence: or, what we later came to call a life” (15). However, by encoding this edition in eXtensible Markup Language (see "Using this Edition" below), the fluid text edition of the Decay of Lying attempts to create a version of the text that can leverage the affordances of computational and distant reading methods for a historically and materially sensitive reading. Indeed, a close-reading or "slow" reading (Robin Valenza) alongside data analysis and computational methods can be co-ordinated and complimentary in ways that can yield new insights about the text, whether through the uncovering of hitherto unidenitified or neglected evidence or new readings that the defamiliarized reading perspective engenders. As John Bryant argues “the notion of textual fluidity is compatible with current critical approaches” (12), as he argues that “the history of textual versions can be seen as an enactment of deconstruction” with “material versions” and revisions materializing “from the moment of genesis and on into print, a constant deferral of the literary work itself” and that “analysis of textual fluidity—writing, revision, and versions—help us historicize the cultural functionality of creative process: the insertions of self into discourse, the modes of revision, the interdependency of writer and culture” (10, 12). And this critical compability extends to (and is accentuated by) the analytical tools that a digital age and computational methods affords.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>
This edition attempts to represent Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" in initial its variants.
            The goal is to enable readers to investigate the hermeneutic significance of text's variability, with variations themselves being utterances that shift a texts meaning and may signal inflections of larger social, cultural, or political forces that are legible in the fluidity of the texts langugage. At the same time, I draw on the great scholarship of Bristow and Mitchell, who situate Wilde's printed version and the manuscript in conversation with his notebooks and extensive reading, helping to elucidate what Van Hulle terms a "creative ecology": "a web of intertextual and intratextual relations” that includes drafts, notebooks, marginalia, and published variants, “present[ing] the oeuvre not just as a set of works, but as a Gestalt, as something that is not just more than the sum of its parts, but also different from the sum of its parts” (40, 48). To bring this network of creative activity, which includes both reading and writing, this genetic or fluid text edition enables users “to read across versions” in a fashion that highlights “the relations between them” by bringing together the excellent commentary and notes of previous Wilde editors Josephine Guy, Horst Schroeder, and Joseph Brisow and Rebecca N. Mitchell alongside my own commentary on the variations present across <em data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>all</em> extant versions (38). Moreover, as discussed in the analytical introduction below, I attempt to highlight moments of what Van Hulle has called "creative concurrenece": the moments of textual and conceptual similarity that emerges across discrete "works" but are apart of the same temporally confined creative activity. Some exemplary instances are discussed below, which also spotlight the <em data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>material</em> component of "creative concurrence" as concepts not only physically move from text to text, but bleed through and become palimpsestically visible. However, these are not mere moments of practical and/or sefl-conscious "Self-Plagiarism" (Guy), but illustrate a creative repurposing and re-envisioning of the same literary material in new phyiscal, temporal, and social moments that constitues a self-reflexive version of what John Bryant calls "adaptive revision." Indeed, beyond the external social and cultural forces that become legible through the text and its variants, the internalization and interpretation of these forces and one's own contributions to the mileau or discourse that comprise these larger cultural sentiments are expressed through both revisions and what is left un revised.

Bristow and Mitchell document the string of sales as follows: “Stuart Mason [Christopher Sclater Millard] recorded its sale at Sotheby’s for 111 on July 26, 1910” after it had been given by Wilde to “Mr Frank Richardson” (see also Stuart Mason [Christopher Millard], <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>Bibliography of Oscar Wilde</i> (London, 1914), 123). They then note that “In 1920, an ‘original manuscript of ‘‘The Decay of Lying’’, written on fifty-five pages folio’ was purchased by distinguished rare book collector Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach for $1,525. It later appeared in the Rosenbach Company’s 1933 sale catalogue, listed at $3,400. The manuscript reappeared in 1937, when, during a recession that halted the post-Depression recovery, the <i data-astro-cid-kh7btl4r>New York Times</i> recorded ‘an autograph manuscript of Oscar Wilde’s ‘‘The Decay of Lying’’, containing about 12,500 words, went to Retz &amp; Storm for $975’ at an auction at the American Art Association’s Anderson Galleries.” How it “became part of the collection of rubber magnate Herman Muehlstein” is not reported, but “in 1957, the University of Akron awarded Muehlstein, President of H. Muehlstein and Co., dealers of plastics and rubber, an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. Two years earlier, Muehlstein had donated a first round of items from his rare book collection to the university and pledged to donate the remainder upon his death. In 1962, the remainder of the bequest, including the fair copy of Wilde’s ‘The Decay of Lying’, entered Akron’s collection.” (573–74).
