Although color lithography and chromolithography are made by the same technique, their visual results—and uses—contrast greatly. Chromolithographs, known familiarly as “chromos,” were typically associated with popular art and decorative materials: trade cards, children’s books, and reproductive prints of paintings. As mass-produced products, chromolithographs were printed widely to meet consumer demand. While this made artistic images available—and affordable—to many, these works were perceived without the aura of exclusivity or creativity of fine-art color lithographs." Wilde once used the term to disparaginly describe the methoeds of Scottish novelists (Reviews 163; Guy 368). The following passage about local colour" closely echoes his earlier critique of Scottish novelists, and may be yet another instance of his "Self-plagiarism," or adaptive revision of his other works, demonstrating a self-reflexive dimension to his "creative ecology" (Van Hulle). https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/hue-cry/chromolithography#:~:text=Chromolithography%20is%20a%20term%20used,%E2%80%94and%20uses%E2%80%94contrast%20greatly.</tei-note><tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb><tei-add change="#StD" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions" data-origname="add"> On seeing them approach, the peasants take refuge in dialect.</tei-add> Mrs<tei-del change="#StD" facs="#f011_z001" data-origname="del">.</tei-del> Oliphant prattles pleasantly<tei-note data-origname="note">Scottish novelist Margaret Oliphant</tei-note><tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> about curates, lawn-tennis parties, <tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>domesticity, and other wearisome things.<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb>Mr<tei-del change="#StD" facs="#f011_z004" data-origname="del">.</tei-del> Marion Crawford has immolated<tei-note data-origname="note">As Guy notes, "a popular and prolific ex-patriot American author and historian" (368).</tei-note><tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> himself upon the altar of local<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> colour.

As Andrew Elfenbein has persausively argued in "On the Discrimination of Influences” (MLQ, esp. 496-505), Wilde's novel simultaneously mocks and adopts certain textual features of teh extremely popular novel, illustrating the complex "influece" of reading on composition. Wilde's iterative passes at this part of the essay not only suggests a clear preoccupation with novel in fashion that materially substantiates Elfenbein's claims, but also, as an illustration of Van Hulle's notion of creative concurrence, materializes in a confluence of creative activity the social, dialectic nature of writing (and literary influence, as Elfenbein argues).</tei-note><tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> of course, a masterpiece—a masterpiece<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> of the <tei-del change="#StD" facs="#f011_z008" data-origname="del">'</tei-del><tei-add change="#StD" facs="#f011_z008" place="intentions" data-origname="add">"</tei-add>genre ennuyeux,<tei-del change="#StD" facs="#f011_z008" data-origname="del">'</tei-del><tei-add change="#StD" facs="#f011_z008" place="intentions" data-origname="add">"</tei-add> the one form<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> of literature that English people<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> seem to thoroughly enjoy. <tei-add change="#StD" facs="#f011_z017" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions" data-origname="add">A thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that it reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in the house of a serious Nonconformist family, and we can quite believe it. </tei-add><tei-note data-origname="note">"A meat-tea was a more substantial meal takien later in the day, and is used by W to indicate the indicate the eating habits of the lower classes or of those who disregarded, or wer ignorant of, the rules of etiquette which governed polite society. . .Nonconformist was a broad term in the 19th century to refer to a variety of of Protestant sects whcih defined themselves in opposition to the teachings of the Anglican or established chruch; in Culture and Anarchy (1869) Matthew Arnold identified nonconformiism with pronvincialism and culgarity, and criticized its partisan tendencies as culturally divisive.</tei-note>Indeed it is<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> only in England that such a book could be <tei-del change="#StD" facs="#f011_z013" hand="#Wilde" data-origname="del">possible </tei-del><tei-add change="#StD" facs="#f011_z013" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions" data-origname="add">produced</tei-add>.<tei-note facs="#f011_z017" data-origname="note">This passage underwent revisions in in each iteration of the essay. Wilde first expanded the Berg version, introducing the "friend" framework, when drafting this fair-copy version. Then, when restoring the ommitted passage for Intentions, he changed the language to include Cyril: "mine" was changed to "ours" and me to "us". The friends enjoyment of the story, and any "praise" given to it, were also removed. "he liked it because" was excised, and already revised "praise we can give to it" ("thing that can be said to its favour" upon initial inscription") was changed to "and we can quite believe it." The passage was relocated to before "Indeed" and the sentence "England is the home of lost ideas" was added after the "produced" (altered from "possible")</tei-note> . <tei-add change="#StD" facs="#f011_z017" hand="#Wilde" place="intentions" data-origname="add">England is the home of lost ideas.</tei-add>As<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> for that great and dailyincreasing<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> school of novelists for whom the<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> sun always rises in the East-End, the<tei-lb data-origname="lb" data-empty=""></tei-lb> only thing that can be said about them</tei-p>
