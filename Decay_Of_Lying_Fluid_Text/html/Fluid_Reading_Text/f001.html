				<tei-p data-origname="p">1.Cyril and Vivian were the names of Wilde's two sons. Nottinghamshire is a county in the English Midlands. Guy suggests that Wilde "may have had a specific country house in mind - the rectory in Bingham (in the east of the county) the incumbent of which was the Revd Robert Miles (1819-83), the father of one of Wilde's artist-friends, Frank Miles (1852-91)." Schroeder disagrees, offering instead the possibility of the "Clumber House (rebuilt 1879, demolished 1938) near Worksop, the seat of the seventh Duke of Newcastle, Henry Pelham-Clinton (1864-1928), where Wilde stayed in Nov. 1886 and Oct. 1888." (Guy 360, Schroeder 22).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">2.Jean Baptiste Corot, the French landscape painter, frequently alluded to and praised in Wilde's writing. In his review titled "The New President," composed concurrently to the earliest drafts of "The Decay of Lying" Wilde alludes to Corot in his critique of Wyke Bayliss, President of the Royal Society of Arts: "What is the use of telling artists that they should try and paint Nature as she really is? What nature really is, is a question for metaphysics, not for art. Art deals with appearances, and the eye of the man who looks at Nature, the vision in fact of the artist, is far more imporant to us than what he looks at. There is more truth in Corot's aphorism, that a landscape is simply the 'mood of a man's mind,' than theire is in al Mr. Bayliss's laborious disquisitions on naturalism" (PMG, Jan. 26, 1889).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">3. Popular English Landscape painter, John Constable</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">4.Schroeder identifies Politics, I.iii.18 as Wilde's reference. As Guy and Bristow and Mitchell point out, Wilde read widely and was deeply familiar with classical literature and philosophy.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">5. Schroeder argues that this is both a challenging of John Addington Symonds 1887 assertion that "it will never match the infinite variety and subtlety of nature; no drawing or painting will equal the primary beauties of the living model' (The Model', Fortnightly Review , vol.42, (Dec. 1887), p 859) and an allusiton to Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, II.ii.239 f.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">6. Large commercial furniture firm, located at Tottenham Court Road.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">7. Guy identifies the reference as an allusion to "the simple, inexpensive, black-stained rush-bottomed 'Sussex' chairs" sold by Morris &amp; Co., "a firm established by poet, painter, and designer William Morris" (362).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">8. The addition is a slight misquotation of Wordsworth's "The Power of Music"</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">9. Guy suggests that this may be a reference to the ongoing discourse on education reforms taking place in the Nineteenth Century. See also Guy, “Self-Plagiarism, Creativity and Craftsmanship in Oscar Wilde.” English Literature in Transition, 1880-1920, no. 41, 1998, pp. 6–23.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">10. See also "The Critic as Artist": "we are never more true to ourselves than when we are inconsistent" (Schroeder 27).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">11. A reference to Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance." In the essay, Emerson writes that the two "terrors" of self-reliance are conformity and consistency. He writes: "The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them. . . A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.--'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.'--Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood." Guy notes that Wilde frequently referenced Emerson throughout his career, and even requested a volume of his essays while in prison.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">12. See also Wilde's 1882 lecture "The English Renaissance of Art" for a similar argument (Guy 363).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">13. Schroeder suggests this is a reformulation of Byron's Don Juan, Canto XI, stanza 37: "And, after all, what is a lie? 'Tis but /The truth in masquerade."</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">14. "Ancient schools of rhetoric located in Leontini in Sicily" (Guy 364)</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">15. The revival Vivian refers to is an invention. As Josephine Guy notes, "the original Retrospective Review, founded in 180 and runnign until 1828, dealt with historical and antiquarian subjects; a second Retrospective Review—which (according to Evans) consisted of criticism of, and extracts from, curious and rare books­—was briefly published in 1853-4 (Evans 295)" (Guy 364).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">16. roses were frequently associated with Aestheticism, and particularly Walter Pater (usually satirical; see "Mr Rose" by W.H. Mallock in The New Republic. See Guy 364.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">17. Roman emperor "renowned for cruelty and decadent behavior"; referenced in both Dorian Gray and in letter describing a friend, "perhaps Lord Alfred Douglas" (Guy 364).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">18. Schroeder argues that this passage was the basis for a passage in Max Beerbom's Parody of 1893 parody "Oscar Wilde." See Anglo-American Times, 25 March 1893 and Schroeder 28.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">19. In the cut directions, Cyril takes a characteristically decadent position, like that of “A Decadent Girl” (1899) by Ramón Casas (1866-1932). https://melbourneartclass.com/the-art-of-fin-de-siecle/</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">20. Referring to government publications of official reports, which had blue bindings.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">21. One of the many references to Zola as the figure head of literary naturalism.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">22. As Guy notes, Wilde presumably means the national library, the Bibliothèque Nationale, in Paris. 23. Schroeder argues that this passage was the basis for a passage in Max Beerbom's Parody of 1893 parody "Oscar Wilde." See Anglo-American Times, 25 March 1893 and Schroeder 28.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">24. Guy notes that this may have been an allusion to Whistler, who had previously accused Wilde of plagiarism and would later accuse him of plagiarizing "The Decay of Lying" from his Lectures. This prompted a series of additions to the Intentions edition of "The Decay of Lying" directed at Whilster.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">25. Possible allusion to Zola's L'Assomoir</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">26. Reference to The Republic, Book 10, 595 ff. (Guy 366). One can trace the connection between lying and poetry to "poiesis," derived from the Greek "ποιεῖν" or "to make." I.e., both are acts of creating something wholly new, which Wilde continues to position in opposition to realism or naturalism's mimetic attempts at REpresentation. See also the addition to Folio 53.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">27 Serialized in 1883. Published as a book in 1888. As Guy notes, Wilde wrote to Ross from Reading Gaol, "complaining about the state of the prison library and suggesting that he might present the authorities with 'a dozen good novels', including 'Stevenson (none here but the Black Arrow!)'" (Guy 367, quoting H &amp; H-D, 646, 790).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">28. Both Guy and Schroeder suggest that Wilde was likely interested in the (accurate) accusations of plagiarism levied at Haggard in the Pall Mall Gazette. Guy and Schroeder both identify Haggard's Allan Quartermain novels as alluded to works containing footnotes. While Guy notes that “pseudo-footnotes by the narrator purporting to authenticate” details about the African setting, containing "information. . .derived from Haggard's own inexperience of Africa," suggests the jab at their inclusion is a straightforward mocking of Haggard’s rhetorical technique. On the other hand, Schroeder, claims that there is “mock-seriousness [to] Haggard's footnotes which Wilde must have enjoyed and which he is here criticizing tongue-in-cheek” (Schroeder 29).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">29. Journalist, biographer, and friend of "one of Wilde's favourite poets, Dante Gabriel Rossetti," Wilde was (reportedly) critical of his Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti immediately following the poets death, and scathingly critiqued his biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge in a review (Guy 367).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">30. James Payn, prolific mid-nineteenth century journalist, poet, essayist, and novelist.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">31. Scottish writer of what, as Guy explains, was "disparagingly referred to as the Kailyard (or cabbage-patch) School" (368). Also a pun on the myth of Phaeton.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">32. Per the Clarck Art Museum: "Chromolithography is a term used for color lithographs characterized by saturated, high-gloss color, usually covering the entire sheet. Although color lithography and chromolithography are made by the same technique, their visual results—and uses—contrast greatly. Chromolithographs, known familiarly as “chromos,” were typically associated with popular art and decorative materials: trade cards, children’s books, and reproductive prints of paintings. As mass-produced products, chromolithographs were printed widely to meet consumer demand. While this made artistic images available—and affordable—to many, these works were perceived without the aura of exclusivity or creativity of fine-art color lithographs." Wilde once used the term to disparaginly describe the methoeds of Scottish novelists (Reviews 163; Guy 368). The following passage about local colour" closely echoes his earlier critique of Scottish novelists, and may be yet another instance of his "Self-plagiarism," or adaptive revision of his other works, demonstrating a self-reflexive dimension to his "creative ecology" (Van Hulle). https://www.clarkart.edu/microsites/hue-cry/chromolithography#:~:text=Chromolithography%20is%20a%20term%20used,%E2%80%94and%20uses%E2%80%94contrast%20greatly.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">33. As Guy notes, "a popular and prolific ex-patriot American author and historian" (368).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">34. Wilde's revised criticisms of the Mary Ward's novel occur both before and after his initial composition of the first version of Dorian Gray in 1890. As Andrew Elfenbein has persausively argued in "On the Discrimination of Influences” (MLQ, esp. 496-505), Wilde's novel simultaneously mocks and adopts certain textual features of teh extremely popular novel, illustrating the complex "influece" of reading on composition. Wilde's iterative passes at this part of the essay not only suggests a clear preoccupation with novel in fashion that materially substantiates Elfenbein's claims, but also, as an illustration of Van Hulle's notion of creative concurrence, materializes in a confluence of creative activity the social, dialectic nature of writing (and literary influence, as Elfenbein argues).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">35. "A meat-tea was a more substantial meal taken later in the day, and is used by W to indicate the indicate the eating habits of the lower classes or of those who disregarded, or were ignorant of, the rules of etiquette which governed polite society. . .Nonconformist was a broad term in the 19th century to refer to a variety of Protestant sects which defined themselves in opposition to the teachings of the Anglican or established church; in Culture and Anarchy (1869) Matthew Arnold identified nonconformism with provincialism and vulgarity, and criticized its partisan tendencies as culturally divisive.” (Guy 368).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">36. This passage underwent revisions in each iteration of the essay. Wilde first expanded the Berg version, introducing the "friend" framework, when drafting this fair-copy version. Then, when restoring the omitted passage for Intentions, he changed the language to include Cyril: "mine" was changed to "ours" and me to "us". The friend’s enjoyment of the story, and any "praise" given to it, were also removed. "he liked it because" was excised and already revised "praise we can give to it" ("thing that can be said to its favour" upon initial inscription") was changed to "and we can quite believe it." The passage was relocated to before "Indeed" and the sentence "England is the home of lost ideas" was added after the "produced" (altered from "possible")</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">37. See also Wilde’s references to the East-End in Dorian Gray, A Woman of No Importance, The Soul of Man, and his review of Dorinda.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">38. A French author of short stories and novels of the naturalist school. Wilde praises his work and laments Maupassant’s death in letters dating from 1891 and 1899 (Guy 370).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">39. As Guy notes, Wilde’s is “a deliberate misquotation” from Le Roman expérimental. The original translates to “A man of genius is not spiritual, and a man of genius is needed to establish authoritatively the formula for naturalism,” while Wilde’s reads “a man of genius is never witty” (Guy 370, quoting Oeuvres complétes, x. 1245).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">40. Wilde expanded this from a shorter Berg variant, adding “from beginning to end”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">41. Wilde changes the allusion from The Tempest to Molière’s Le Tartuffe, when revising for Intentions. Guy notes that “In De Profundis and a cancelled draft of A Woman of No Importance Wilde cites both characters as interchangeable,” yet this switch reinforces a national lens to this section of the essay, firmly aligning the critique with French literature. Moreover, while Caliban’s anger emerges out of self-reflection, Tartuffe is exposed by others. One is firmly grounded in an inward looking act, while the other external, perhaps echoing the dichotomy the essay crafts between a self-reflexive, creative “lying” and externally focused, mimetic (in someways, Wilde argues, more imitative and deceptive) realism.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">42. The listing of additional novels in Zola’s Rougons and Macquart cycle was an addition made upon inscribing the Akron MS.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">43. John Ruskin on Geroge Eliot’s The Mill on the Floss, in “Fiction – Fair and Foul V”, Nineteenth Century, 10 (1881), 521</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">44. Wilde cuts from the Berg variant the rest of the line, Daudet's Fromont jeune et Risler aîné “Je n'ai pas le droit de renoncer au théâtre.” As Schroeder notes, these are the actual lines the actor actually “keeps repeating” (32). Wilde keeps the lines translating to “it is necessary to struggle for art,” but removes the following line “I have no right to give it up.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">45. Throughout, Wilde continually revies “me” and “I” to “us” and “we,” both bringing in Cyril as concurring in this line of thinking, and perhaps also implicating the reader and a larger movements. Such revisions work to suggest that this is a part of a larger movement, not just Vivian’s lone opinion. The opening clause of the following sentence is taken from “Balzac in English.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">46. French Poet and Critic.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">47. Added reference to the Parisian quarter on the Left Bank, “traditionally associated with aristocratic society; it features prominently in the novels of Balzac and Bourget” (Guy 372).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">48. Wilde revised this passage multiple times. Lines were cut on the previous folio beginning a reflection on “the mere discussion of modern novels,” and Wilde reformulated the language concluding Vivian’s part here when inscribing the Akron MS and changed “say” to “insist,” a more firm assertion, in Intentions.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">49. Reference to William Paley, who held “several religious offices. . .[and] was the author of many works on moral and theological subjects” (Guy 373).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">50. As Guy notes, “T.H. Green (1836-82), to whom Robert Elsmere is dedicated, was Professor of Moral Philosophy of Oxford from 1878; an idealist philosopher of neo-Kantian school, he exercised a considerable influence on late 19th-century philosophy in England. He appears in Robert Elsmere as the sympathetic Henry Grey, an Oxford don who has forged a workable, if idiosyncratic compromise between his Chrisitan faith, rational scepticism, and social activism” (373)</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">51. French Novelist Honore de Balzac, famous for his extensive series La Comedie humaine, which “was also generally credited with establishing the techniques of realism”; George Meredith, English novelist and poet (Guy 373-4).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">52. Appears in “Literary and Other Notes’ Column of WW. See Guy 374.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">53. Wilde here substitutes “method” for “style.” For the aesthetics, following Pater’s essay “style,” the term held a particular definition as what might be said to be the purest form of self-expression, and thus the most universal, in literature. “The style, the manner, would be the man, not in his unreasoned and really uncharacteristic caprices, involuntary or affected, but in absolutely sincere apprehension of what is most real to him. . . If the style be the man, in all the colour and intensity of a veritable apprehension, it will be in a real sense ‘impersonal’” (36-37). It is “style,” the attempt to reach pure subjectivity outside of cultural constructs that color our impressions of art and the world, that separated the Romantics from the Realists, and, indeed, is the pitfall of Realism that Wilde argues in this essay. In the Berg, he struck Cyril’s rebuttal, “His want of style, you mean” and Vivian’s immediate rebuttal. The following claim that Meredith is “at a heart, a true Romanticist” is integrated further below. Schroeder notes that Wilde here uses “A proverbial expression, derived from 1 Kings 19.18: 'Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal.’” (36)</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">54. As Guy notes, this and the following passages resembles Wilde’s 1886 review of Balzac. The translated quote from French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire, is slightly altered from his essay on “Theophile Gautier” (Guy 375). “Fiery-coloured” is a descriptive phrase that appears in a number of his writings.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">55. 16th century German court painter to Henry the VIII.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">56. All references to novels by Gustave Flaubert</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">57. The deletion of the reference to Schopenhauer may have been a correction, Both Schroeder and Guy identify this is as an allusion to Theophile Gautier. More presciely, his preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin: “Nothing is really beautiful until it is useless; everything useful is ugly, for it expresses a need, and the needs of man are ignoble and idsgustiing, like his poor and weak nature” (Guy 367). This philosophical foundation of this idea comes from Kant’s Critique of Judgement, where a true aesthetic judgement of the beautiful can only be made when an object pleases us in its purposelessness. We have no interest in the object, and we are not “pleased” or “satisfied” with its ability to perform a task or service. We must take pleasure in the object in itself. Nonetheless, the reference to the Pessimist philosopher Arhtur Schopenhauer (who was Kantian in his aesthetics and much of his philosophy), complicates the allusion and its meaning within the context of the essay.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">58. As Guy notes, “most commentators viewed Reade’s Griffith Gaunt (1866) as his best work. In 1884 Swinburn published a detailed appreciation of Reade’s career in the NC. In his article, he favorably compared Reade’s novel – as Wilde goes on to do – with George Eliot’s Romola” (377). The privileging of Romola over Daniel Deronda may stem from its setting: 15th Century Italy versus contemporary Victorian society.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">59. Wilde uses the same phrase in his December 1888 article “A Note on Some Modern Poets” and in his column “The Poets’ Corner’” in the April 6, 1888 issue of the Pall Mall Gazette</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">60. This partial quote from Troilus and Cressida was added in the 1891 publication, but appears in Variants elsewhere. As Guy reports, it was included in “an unpublished manuscript dating from the 1880s. . .comprising draft aphorisms and epigrams (some of which were revised for ‘Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young). . .It is impossible to know whether this aphorism was inspired Whistler’s lecture (first delivered and reviewed by Wilde in 1885), or whether it had come to Wilde independently’” (378). The allusion also appears, recontextualized and with new meaning, in An Ideal Husband.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">The movement of this passage across a number of materials, its relationship to his reading and perhaps his attendance at a lecture, and the creative reappropriation and reimagining of the quote in new creative contexts makes apparent the fluidity and permeability of textual boundaries, as ideas and phrases move across different “texts” and take on new meanings in various material and temporal environments.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">61. A nineteenth century commonplace to consider Wordsworth’s poetry as varying drastically in its merits, largely ushered in by the Second Wave Romantics criticisms of Wordsworth’s later poetry (particularly The Excursion), a poetic fall in quality they tied with his notorious conservative turn.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">62. From Wordsworth’s “The Tables Turned”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">63. Wilde’s addition of the following clause and sentence complicates the previous notion about the poet’s subjectivity and reception of aesthetic experience. Cyril’s claim that “the return to Nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great personality” could be construed in two ways. Either, it may constitute an identification with a Pantheistic Oversoul that permeates all “persons”—drawing upon Emerson and earlier Romantic contentions of nature. Or, it may be a view of Nature as “abolishing” individuality—the erasure of individuality and subjective experience through the connection or “return to” an all-encompassing Absolute connection to “Nature,” creating a singular “objective” experience. These positions are not mutually exclusive, and indeed many scholars have read pantheism and Romantic conceptions of nature as an subsumption of individuality by the impersonal. Relatedly, Hilda Schiff’s influential reading of the essay argues that Wilde offers a conception of the artist-nature relationship in which, in deference to nature as the ideal, nature not only fails to “unite” with the individual, but “abolishes” the artist by “abstracting” the artist (“Nature and Art in Oscar Wilde’s ‘The Decay of Lying’ 87).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">64. Guy notes a similarity between Wilde’s history of art and Whistler’s in the “Ten O’Clock” lecture.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">65. The omission of “re-writes history,” present in the Berg variant may be to avoid repetition with his assessment of the “Dramatic Arts” below.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">66. British Decadence in the fin-de-siecle as a movement, of which Wilde was a literary figurehead, was deeply indebted to works by Edgar Allan Poe, Theophile Gautier, and Charles Baudelaier and epitomized by Joris-Karl Huysmans’s novel A Rebour, figures referenced here and throughout Wilde’s ouevere. The movement held, as its “basic principle,” the “complete opposition to Nature: hence its systematic cultivation of drugs, cosmetics, Catholic ritual, supposedly ‘unnatural’ sexual practices, and sterility and artificiality in all things.” Arthur Symons, “in his essay ‘The Decadent Movement in Literature’ (1893), described the phenomenon as ‘an interesting disease’ typical of an over-luxurious civilization, characterized by ‘an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity’.” (Baldick, Chris. "decadence." The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, Oxford University Press, 2015).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">See also Mahoney, Kristin. “Decadence.” Victorian Literature and Culture 46.3–4 (2018): 636–640.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">67. See “The Critic as Artist”: “The one duty we owe to history is to rewrie it. That is not the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Hilda Schiff claims, in passages like this, that Wilde moves to position nature as “a starting-point” that “has challenged man to improve upon her imperfections” (88).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">68. From “Nature and Art.” Quoted also by Pater and Matthew Arnold in their essays on Henri Frederic Amiel’s Journal intime. Wilde drafted an unpublished review for this work as well. The ideas expressed here by Goethe, the prominent figurehead of German Romanticism and a touchstone for many Romantic writers that followed, not only are similarly echoed by the Jena Romantics, but throughout the nineteenth century. Walter Pater, in his essay “Style” (which has oft been cited as the most apparent influence on Wilde’s essay and the aesthetic philosophy, and may have been directly referenced in Wilde’s capitalization of the term here the Akron MS) similarly writes:</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">“Here, then, with a view to the central need of a select few, those " men of a finer thread " who have formed and maintain the literary ideal, everything, every component element, will have undergone exact trial, and, above all, there will be no uncharacteristic or tarnished or vulgar decoration, permissible ornament being for the most part structural, or necessary. As the painter in his picture, so the artist in his book, aims at the production by honourable artifice of a peculiar atmosphere. " The artist," says Schiller, " may be known rather by what he omits" ; and in literature, too, the true artist may be best recognised by his tact of omission.” (emphasis added).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">For, according to Pater, the removal of “surplage” allows for the artist to express what he calls the “mind in style”: “a more intimate quality of good style : more intimate, as coming nearer to the artist himself.” Such a style would be a pure mediation of subjective experience, unifying sign and signified in the act of expression: “All the laws of good writing aim at a similar unity or identity of the mind in all the processes by which the word is associated to its import. The term is right, and has its essential beauty, when it becomes, in a manner, what it signifies, as with the names of simple sensations. To give the phrase, the sentence, the structural member, the entire composition, song, or essay, a similar unity with its subject and with itself:—style is in the right way when it tends towards that.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">69. Josephine Guy suggests that Wilde “is almost certainly thinking of Henry Arthur Jones” who he “refereed to disparagingly in ‘The Critic as Artist’” (382). However, the MS evidences his reference here to Henry Pettitt and George Robert Sims, both prolific playwrights (Sims was also a poet, journalist, and novelist; Pettitt an actor). They were also collaborators on a significant number of works. At this point in time two of their most popular collaborative works, In the Ranks (1883) and Harbour Lights (1885), which had 457 and 513 performances respectively at London’s famous Adelphi Theatre, had been released. As Schroeder correctly infers, “Theatres noted for their productions of melodrama were the Princess's and, above all, the Adelphi which had become a byword for melodrama ('Adelphi melodrama'). Besides, the most representative authors of the genre were Henry Pettitt, Sydney Grundy and George Robert Sims” (39).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">70. Wilde’s deletion here conflates between the novel as form with the “imitative form of literature,” or realism as a genre, suggesting a pervasiveness of the realist genre to the degree that it could be implied through mere reference to the novel.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">71. Wilde’s cut reference to “Gobelins” corroborates Guy’s connection of this passage to his review of William Morris’s lecture, “Carpet and Tapestry Weaving.” Wilde not only paraphrases, but pulls language directly from the review, again reimagining, and imbuing with new meaning (and perhaps enacting his own theory of layering art upon art), his previous prose within the new context of the essay. It is not merely a “restatement in different terms, of many ideas first broached in the earlier Reviews,” as R.J. Green argues, but creative, adaptive revision of his previous writing for an entirely creative act (398). https://link-gale-com.ezproxy.lib.uconn.edu/apps/doc/BA3200413854/BNCN?u=22516&amp;sid=bookmark-BNCN&amp;pg=6&amp;xid=10ba7768</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">72. While the term “originally. . .designated the Isrealites,” Matthew Arnold popularized the term in British literary and cultural criticism in his essay “Heine” in Essays in Criticism. As Josephine Guy explains, Arnold “uses it to designate an ‘inveterate inaccessibility to ideas’ in those Englishman deficient in liberal culture; later in Culture and Anarchy (1869) he uses it to indicate the prosaic materialism and anti-intellectualism of the middle classes” (383). Guy offers a theory in her introduction to the volume that Wilde’s spur of critical publications in 1888-9 may have emerged as a response to Pater (particularly the essay “Style”) and as a way of taking up literary criticism as a “role of the social critic. . .at the very center of cultural life,” a position left un-dominated by the death of Matthew Arnold (xxxiii-xxxiv).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">73. Guy suggests Wilde is referring to D.A. Bingham’s 1884 A Selection from the Letters and Despatches of the First Napoleon. Also, Murray “comments that in Representative Men, Emerson described Napolean as ‘a bounlaess liar’” (Guy 387, quoting Murray 592). Thomas Carlyle, the Scottish Essayists and historian, was also a translator of many German Romantic works. His translations, as well as Sartor Resartus, were markedly influential on the American Transcendentalist movement, figure headed by Emerson, but which also included writers like Margaret Fuller and Henry David Thoreau. In fact, Edgar Allan Poe, alluded to by Wilde in works like “The Harlot’s House” and a key point of reference for British Decadent writers (and also, like Wilde, a habitual “self-plagiarist), continually criticized the New England Transcendentalists writers for the overt Carlylean style and conceits.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">For example, in 1842, Poe derided Emerson’s prose for being obscurest and unintelligible: “Quintilian mentions a pedant who taught obscurity, and who once said to a pupil “this is excellent, for I do not understand it myself.” How the good man would have chuckled over Mr. E.! His present rôle seems to be the out-Carlyling Carlyle. Lycophron Tenebrosus is a fool to him” (“AN APPENDIX OF AUTOGRAPHS”).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Germane to Wilde’s Paterian influence and discussion of imitation, Poe invoked Carlyle in a short piece appearing in the January 22, 1845 issue of the Evening Mirror entitled, “American Diffuseness—Objectionable Concision.” After lamenting the “diffuseness of the American Legislative oratory,” Poe pivots his attention to the literary and “the species of concision which has been lately introduced among us, through imitation of that prophet in great and quack in little matters, Carlyle.” Prefiguring Pater’s understanding of “Style,” Poe argues that contrary to the goal of concision being “to save time... in saving thought... That style, therefore, is the most truly concise which most rapidly transmits the sense” (Edgar Allan Poe, “American Diffuseness — Objectionable Concision,” Evening Mirror, New York, vol. I, no. 91, January 22, 1845, p. 2, col. 2).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">In the posthumously published “About Critics and Criticism,” he writes: “The manner of Carlyle is conventional — with himself. The style of Emerson is conventional — with himself and Carlyle. The style of Miss Fuller is conventional — with herself and Emerson and Carlyle: — that is to say, it is a triple-distilled conventionality: — and by the word “conventionality,” as here used, I mean very nearly what, as regards personal conduct, we style “affectation” — that is, an assumption of airs or tricks which have no basis in reason or common sense.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">See also Poe, “American Poetry”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">74. Guy suggests that the “dense listing of references is a rhetorical strategy which occurs throughout Wilde's prose,” in-keeping with her argument in “Self-Plagiarism, Creativity and Craftsmanship in Oscar Wilde” about Wilde’s purposeful “self-plagiarism” a “self-conscious strategy” keenly aware of audience, potential reception, and affect. She argues, in short, he makes conscious choices, based on the topicality or generality of his jokes and whether they are likely to “work” with his audience, before reinserting or appropriating previously deployed jokes in a new work and context.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Schroeder disagrees, argues that “Wilde's list of names would have appeared less 'dense' if Guy had realized or if she had told her readers that it is clearly structured: Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages, 16th century, 18th century, 19th century”; “to accuse Wilde of academic showmanship shows a very low opinion of the general cultural competence of Wilde's readers and overlooks the fact that much that has been lost since the early 20th century and that must be retrieved with great effort was part of the living heritage in Victorian times”; and “thee cultural competence required to understand Wilde's 'dense listing of references' was not the privilege of a select few who could boast of having gone to Oxford or Cambridge, but was the common property of a large readership who had received a good education at home and at school” (40).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">However, schools in which intense study of the classics would still be limited to the middle and upper-class citizens (See Robert Altic, British Common Reader 1800-1900).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">References to most the Greek and Roman writers appear also in Wilde’s Historical Criticism and his Commonplace Book.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">75. See “The Canterville Ghost,” chapter 3 of The Picture of Dorian Gray, and “The American Invasion” and “The American Man” for other critiques and jokes at the expense of Americans and American culture.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">76. As Guy points out, this reference to “an extinct genus of a huge herbivorous animal resembling the modern sloth. . .is not as esoteric as it might seem. . .Emerson described how he had ‘just come from Professor Sedgwick’s Cambridge museum of megatheria and mastodon’s’” (Guy 387-388, quoting Emerson, v. 157).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">77. Wilde similarly oscillates between gilded and golden on folio 52. Wilde’s revision here and below seems to reinforce the privileging of ostensible appearances, artifice, and presentation over some "real" "essence" or objective "truth.” The only subjective “truth” is in what we are able to create and present.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">78. Guy and Schroeder disagree on the reference. Guy argues that Wilde “is probably referring to the Royal Society of Literature” which was “modelled on the much older and more famous Royal Society which dated from 1662” while Schroeder argues that it is a direct reference to the older of the two. The “Incorporated Authors” may, as Murray suggests, be “ an allusion to the ‘Society of Authors’” (Guy 388, Murray 593). The Society, to which Wilde had been elected a member of in 1887, was established in 1884 to “protect writers’ financial interests.” (Guy 388). He may have also had the 1888 banquet at Criterion Restaurant, which was held to “recognize the efforts of American Authors to gain international copyright” (Guy 388).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">79. Francis Cowley Burnand was a loud critic of the aesthetes, especially in his role as he editor of Punch from 1880-1906.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">80. Guy suggests this may be an allusion to Wordsworth’s “Intimations of Immortality.” Wilde cuts from the Berg variant the most explicit indictment of Realism and Naturalism for the mimetic “tenets,” by removing the reference to photography, which, it could be argued in a gross over-simplification, captures (purportedly) “life” at is “objectively” perceived in a single moment.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">81. Guy points to “Wildes’s best-known aphorisms, in “The Nightingale and the Rose” an Act III of The Importance of being Earnest, but the clause appears to also be a clear reference to Pater’s “Style.” Pater writes, “The style, the manner, would be the man, not in his unreasoned and really uncharacteristic caprices, involuntary or affected, but in absolutely sincere apprehension of what is most real to him.” And “In the highest as in the lowliest literature, then, the one indispensable beauty is, after all, truth :—truth to bare fact in the latter, as to some personal sense of fact, diverted somewhat from men's ordinary sense of it, in the former ; truth there as accuracy, truth here as expression, that finest and most intimate form of truth, the vraie verite. And what an eclectic principle this really is ! employing for its one sole purpose— that absolute accordance of expression to idea— all other literary beauties and excellences whatever : how many kinds of style it covers, explains, justifies, and at the same time safeguards!” (Appreciations 36, 34).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">82. Wilde has notes on Spencer’s work in Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy in his Commonplace Book.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">83. A likely reference to the 19th Century rise in compiling statistics, which came about alongside the rise and formation of contemporary disciplines, scientific and otherwise, and their institutionalization by both Universities and the Government. See note to Blue-Books (where these government statistics were compiled) above. Wilde may have had Henry Buckle’s historiography and History of Civilization in England in mind here. See Guy 389-390.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">84. Guy speculates that Wilde is here alluding to :an unsigned and partly critical review” by Alexander Ross on his own The Happy Prince and Other Tales (390).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">85. Wilde omits the description of the non-European countries as “strange lands,” tamping down the overt othering within the essay itself, perhaps universalizing Art, but also betrays a clear Eurocentrism in keeping with predominant ideologies of the period.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">86. Guy’s Notes and Queries article reports that, on the back of f19 of the Berg MS is a fair-copy of a review for Wyke Bayliss’s The Enchanted Isle, which came out the same month as “Decay of Lying”. Both sides carry allusions/direct references to Shakespeare’s The Tempest, forming the basis for her argument that Wilde’s notorious “Self-Plagiarism[s]” may actually be a result of complex drafting process where multiple drafts of the same and different pieces were being composed simultaneously. While this may not explain away extensive reusing's of whole passages, like his discussion of Balzac above, which is almost wholly lifted from his review published a few years prior, it does suggest an interestingly recursive composition process; a drafting process that would account for the initial reference to Caliban above that was replaced in the 1891 variant. Wilde’s writing in this recursive and reiterative fashion, in which he lifts and recontextualizes whole passages, may be yet another form of the type of “creative synthesis”(Bristow and Mitchell) or “absorption” and “communication with style” (Schiff) that enacts the aesthetic theory Schiff reads in essay (or a necessity when writing so prolifically). It is not “imitative” but a wholly new creation out of the very same material/constitutive parts. Moreover, it demonstrates that textual fluidity is not bounded by a single work-concept, but extends, as Van Hulle shows, throughout a whole oeuvre and another exemplar of “creative concurrence.” Ideas are articulated, rearticulated, reimagined amidst new contexts, even if the words are largely the same.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">87. Wilde’s “inversion of Shakespeare’s lines may have been suggested to him by a definition of style given by the artist and Poet Selwyn Image in an 1887 lecture which Wilde reviewed for the Sunday Times” (Guy 390). As Guy quotes, Wilde paraphrased Image, writing, “Art. . .must not content itself simply with holding the mirror up to nature, for it’s a re-creation more than a reflection. . . it is no longer the duty of art to hold the mirror up to nature”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">88. From Percy Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound. Lines copied into his Commonplace Book.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">89. “Le Gallienne quoted these two sentences - in their original Nineteenth Century form - in his book on George Meredith, published in Nov. 1890: 'it is true that Art (to quote the beautiful words of Mr Oscar Wilde), ‘has flowers that no botanist knows of, birds that no museum possesses," that "she can bid the almond tree blossom in winter, and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield.’” (Schroeder 45).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">90. Wilde significantly alters Cyril’s response for the 1891 edition. The shift from challenging or construing “lying” as “dangerous” to an affirmation may be a revision inflected by several factors. One may have been the rhetoric of reviewers like Alice Meynell, who wrote “The Decay of Lying” declares war, with all the irresponsibility naturally attending an act so serious in the history of the world” (“Unit of the World,” The Scots Observer, vol. 1 no. 11, February 2, 1889, 296-297).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">The other would be the general reaction to the aesthetes and decadents as social and cultural deviants. Perhaps the revision would be an attempt to avoid provoking such connotations and reactions by explicitly calling to mind the socio-cultural danger of their radical aesthetic movement, and the other nonconformist positions the movement was associated with. The below mentioning of danger in association with paradox is qualified as only “seem[ing]” like a paradox.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">91. References to the Pre-Raphelite panters Dante Garbiel Rossetti and Edward Burne Jones. Wilde praised Burne-Jones as “one of ‘the greatest masters of colour we have ever had in England’” (Guy 392).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">92. 17th Century Flemish court painter. He “exercised a considerable influence on English portraiture; the National Gallery purchased a number of his works, including in 1885 the famous Equestrian portrait of Charles I.” See also Act I of An Ideal Husband. (Guy 392).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">93. Guy draws attention to the “numerous public enquiries and legislative measures designed to improve public health, including the 1875 Artisan’s Dwelling act which empowered local authorities to make compulsory purchases of land to build new dwellings to house those most in need. These measures in turn were inspired by the pioneering Report on the Condition of the Labouring Classes by Edwin Chadwick which compiled a mass of data about the living conditions of the labouring classes, including numerous ‘sanitary’ maps and graphs correlation the worst instances of disease with dirt, overcrowding, and dilapidated dwellings” (393). However, Wilde’s initial choice of “beauty,” revised to condition, prioritizes aesthetic appearance, rather than the “condition.” Moreover, Wilde struck the class distinction for a generalizing “people,” only to reinject the class framework in Intentions, a trend of moving towards a more vocal elitism in in the later variants that suggests a growing consciousness of class or of class conflict.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">94. The shift from “fact” to “word” echoes Pater’s distinction between the lesser “truth” of “fact” and the “higher,” more “intimate truth” of expression. It also shifts from “objective” to “subjective” understanding. See the use of Fact below</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">95. Schroeder erroneously notes, “Due to a grotesque printer's error, the 'silly boys' in the original periodical version of the essay, brandish 'loaded revolvers'” (48). In fact, “loaded” was a deliberate addition to the MS, while the “un” was only added in the 1891 edition. The original version seems to imply the threat of the poor youth in urban London attacking and preying on visiting “gentleman”, while the later variant, with the specific reference to “suburban lanes,” and the addition of “un” suggests that these are the “silly,” mischievous acts of wealthy middle and upper class, suburban boys who have access to the new, expensive novels (Price, Leah, “Victorian Reading.” The Cambridge History of Victorian Literature, ed. Kate Flint, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 40).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">96. Reference to the Nihilist Philosophy and Russian movement, widles covered in the English newspapers of the time. Wilde positively reviewed these Russian novelists in the Pall Mall Gazette.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">97. A leader of the French Revolution.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">98. See again Wilde’s review of Balzac. The addition of “the stage” reinforces the “creative” aspect of art that gives form to the performance of life. See the addition of “creative vision” below, which again suggests art and culture structure our understanding and perception of “objective” reality.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">99. Wilde here, again, delineates between “method” and “style.” Removal of the explanation of “her husband” injects ambiguity into the story.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">100. “important center for gambling, and attracted a wealthy British clientele,” the Monte Carlo is also referenced in Dorian Gray and De Profundis.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">101. See the North London areas in Charles Booth’s Map color coded black, or “Lowest class, Vicious, Semi-criminal” https://booth.lse.ac.uk/map/browse</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">102. Removal “the child” dehumanizes the “it” he sees in the “evil-looking streets.” And the Removal of “looking” linguistically renders the subjective impression a statement of objective “fact.”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">103. As Guy notes, this closely mirrors Wilde’s own life, as he took his final exams in June 1878, and his degree was conferred in November of that year (396).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">104. Wilde’s series of revisions literally exoticize the woman, and while careful to avoid using “nature,” character here seems to be aligned with the identity or “personality” of the subject that is expressed through art. The description of her as one who “would give herself up entirely to Art” and “a failure in all her transformations,” suggests, as frequently asserted by the Aesthetes and Decadent writers, a certain impossibility or inevitable failure in their artistic pursuits.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">105. Wilde frequently levied harsh critiques at philanthropy. See The Soul of Man and De Profundis, for example (Guy 397).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">106. May be reference to his own translation of Ivan Turgenev’s ‘A Fire at Sea’ (Guy 397). The addition also firmly establishes the chronology of art first, life follows.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">107. Reference to Giovanni Bellini, 15th and 16th Century painter praised by Ruskin and Symonds. The addition, added in 1891, may also signal an early contemplation of the decapation of John the Baptist that Wilde dramatized in Salome. For Bellini is one of the painter’s to whom The Head of John the Baptist held at the Civic Museum in Pesaro is attributed.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Guy also suggests that the mention of “gondolas” is an inside joke at the expense of Symonds, who “was notorious among a small circle of friends for his infatuation with a Venetian gondolier” (397).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">108. Reference to the protagonist of the prominent French Romantic writer Alfred de Musset’s Rolla.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">109. Who implemented the revision from René , an allusion to Chateaubriand’s influential novella, to an allusion to Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, is unknown. But both are key Romantic texts.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">110. This lengthy passage is not, as Guy argues, a revised reinstatement, but entirely new material. However, whether it is a “part of [his] long quarrel with Whistler” or an echo of his beliefs expressed in other reviews, remains up to critical debate (Guy 398, Schroder 52-3).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">111. Guy writes that Wilde’s “understanding” of the “extremely complex. . .history of the reception of Impressionist art in Britain (and of the British school of Impressionists). . .[was] developed in part via his reading of Pater, encompassed poetry as well as painting, and was conflated (somewhat confusingly) with Romanticism” (398).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">112. French landscape painter of the Barbizon school</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">113. French Impressionist painters.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">114. “Other works - besides Lady Windermere's Fan - in which Wilde satirizes the vogue for sunsets are: first, 'The Relation of Dress to Art', Wilde's 'Note in Black and White on Mr Whistler's Lecture' (28 Febr. 1885), where he talks of 'a foolish sunset as a background'; second, 'The Canterville Ghost' (Febr. / March 1887) where Virginia accuses Sir Simon of having stolen all her reds, 'including the vermilion', so that she 'couldn't do any more sunsets'; and third, the review 'A Batch of Novels' (May 1887) where Wilde praises Rosa Mulholland for her 'treatment of external nature' in her novel Marcella Grace : 'She never shrieks over scenery like a tourist, nor wearies us with sunsets like the Scotch school.'” (Schroeder 53).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">115. English landscape painter, J.M.W. Turner, whose reputation was “defended” by Ruskin, leading to an explosion in popularity. “By the late 1880s, however, both Turner and Ruskin were thought old-fashioned” (Guy 399). 116. A renewed reference to René, which, as noted above, was cut in favor of an allusion to Werther. Vautrin is the central “master criminal” in Balzacs Comédie humaine. “Theodore Rousseau (1812-1867), the central figure of the Barbizon School” (Schroeder 54).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">117. 17th Century Dutch Painter Aelbert Cuyp.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">118. See Pater’s “Style”: “If music be the ideal of all art whatever, precisely because in music it is impossible to distinguish the form from the substance or matter, the subject from the expression” (37). 119. likely a reference to Ovid’s Metamorphoses specifically, Wilde “frequently” used the story of Apollo and Marsyas, “to trope artistic value” (Guy 401).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">120. Allusion to Dante’s Il Paradiso and Pater.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">121. The removal of “reflections” and “echoes” suggests a semiotic or representative, rather than re-presentation or remediation.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">122. Wilde’s 1882 Lecture ‘The English Renaissance of Art’ “anticipates” this passage: ‘Those strange, wiled-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirl wind of ecstasy, those mighty limbed and Titan Prophets, labouring with the secret of the earth and the burden of mystery, the guard and glorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome­—do they not tell us more of the real spirit of the Italian Renaissance. . .than all the brawling boors and cooking women of Dutch art can teach us of the real spirit of the history of Holland” (Guy 402).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Again, Wilde’s reconfiguration of previous prose for new purposes and contexts exemplifies a self-reflexive adaptive revision. The fluid-text is not limited to the titular “work” but broader social and cultural contexts, ideas, and even precise language, impinge upon and make themselves known through the act of inscription.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">123. The addition of “upon the other hand” furthers the discursive nature of the text, as dialogues and various perspectives are argued not only between speakers, but within speakers. And another layer of this discursive takes place between reader and writer, that occurs during the practice of writing, reading, and subsequent revisions.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">124. The addition of the M.S.S. extends the realm of art to include literature.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">125. The revision from “medium” to “presented” removes the possibility of “knowledge” of a “mediated” truth, but instead a purely aesthetic (subject-object perception) relationship.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">126. Again, Art is construed as the purposeful expression of individuality and the unfiltered subjective experience.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">127. This passage underwent heavy revision. The first significant change is the two separate removals of “photographs,” and instead goes to the “life”, the “real Japanese gentleman or lady,” removes any possibility of distortion through remediation, and focuses most explicitly on mimetic arts.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Then, the removal of “wonderful, strange, or imaginative” for “curious, or extraordinary” avoids any belittling (like the cut reference to Lilliput), but instead attempts to “normalize” the Japanese people. But, as Grace E. Lavery demonstrates, this rhetorical move doubly others and (violently) exoticizes Japan as both exceptional because it is not Britain, but also because it is not like the East and like Britain. This is, as Lavery points out, linguistically reified and enacted in words like “exquisite” which Wilde adds below. See Lavery, Grace E. Quaint, Exquisite: Victorian Aesthetics and the Idea of Japan. Princeton University Press, 2019. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvc77d7b.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Alluding to Mortimer Menpes, Guy suggests the cut reference to Velasquez was initially intended “to annoy Whistler. . . who was more usually associated with Velasquez. . .[and] who was by far the more accomplished painter.” In-line with her logic in “Self-Plagiarism” Guy suggests the joke was cut because “the joke no longer worked. . .because by 1891 Menpes’s numerous one-man shows were proving to be extremely popular” (403).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">128. This added section helps to clarify, in very problematic fashion, that it is art as culture that structures and frames our perception of “Nature” or the world around us, and that we always understand the world through our previous encounters with culture, rather than “Nature” informing our understanding of Art and Culture.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">129. The revision features a provocative shift in agency.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">130. Allusion to Frederick William Henry Meyers, the President and co-founder of the Society for Psychal Research, and his two-volume Phantasms of the Living. Wilde mocks him in “The Canterval Ghost,” “Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime,” and his review of Rhoda Broughton’s Betty’s Visions (Guy 405; Schroeder 57).</tei-p>

				<tei-p data-origname="p">131. As Guy notes, Wilde here is alluding “to the mythopoeic quality of religion. . .largely for comic effect; however, when he revisits the idea in De Profundis it is discussed with much greater seriousness” (Guy 405).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">In the MS, “belief” and “disbelief” are mirrored over the line break, giving the sentence figural and material symmetry.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">132. Guy explains that a “passman” was a “student who graduated from Oxford or Cambridge with a minimum pass rather than honours degree; the latter qualification required a more detailed programme of reading and more rigorous examinations” (405).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">133. Passage pulled from deleted content on 48A</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">134. Guy suggests that “Vivian’s comment is of course a joke about the Victorian thirst for education of all kinds; however it may also reflect Wilde’s own distinction between the amateur raconteur and the professional (that is, non-university) lecturer who was paid for his services” (406).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">135. Quote from William Morris’s 1887 translation of The Odyssey of Homer, which Wilde reviewed for the Paul Mall Gazette in April and Nov. 1887 (Guy 406-407). Of the deletion, Schroeder writes: “In Guy's opinion, the original Nineteenth Century version 'may be a reference to Samuel Henry Butcher, a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who published a popular translation of the Odyssey in 1879' (in collaboration with Andrew Lang). But this does not make sense, as Butcher / Lang do not use the word 'whopper'” (58).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">The shift from an incredulous “whopper” to “sly” deceit furthers the suggestion that “lying” with a purpose of deception or conscious craft, as distinct from “self-conscious” creation/invention, are two distinct acts in Wilde’s aesthetic theory (as put forth here).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">136. The agent behind the change from “rose” to “grew”—with all its natural/organic implication—is undocumented. The revisions of “young” to “mankind” addition of “important” while replacing “whole” further down (around the “question”), all amplify the stakes of the discourse.</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">137. An allusion to Quod Nihil Sictur [That Nothing is Known], by Jesuit scholar, Francisco Sanchez (Guy 407).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">138. As Guy summarizes: “district School Boards were the product of the 1870 Education Act which made elementary schooling compulsory for children aged 5-12. In order to meet this provision, the existing structure of private and church schools had to be supplemented by a network of new state-sponsored institutions funded directly from taxation. These new schools were administered by a directly elected Board which had the power to levy a local education rate to run the school and to compel attendance” (408). See also Barnard, H. C.

For Wilde’s critique of journalism, see Pen, Pencil, and Poison” in which Wilde, writing of Thomas Griggiths Wainewright, humorously writes that it’s a tragedy that his most successful and “influen[tial]” writing was his journalistic style: “To have a style so gorgeous that it conceals the subject is one of the highest achievements of an important and much admired school of Fleet Street leader-writers, and this school Janus Weathercock may be said to have invented. . .A publicist, now-a-days, is a man who bores the community with the details of the illegalities of his private life” (114-115). Later, discussing Wainewright’s exile, the punishment for his crimes, jokingly laments, “there is, however, something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted for, what, if we remember his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst of all his sins” (118-119).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">140. This cut sentence makes the case more explicitly, as Hilda Schiff argues, that Wilde construed “lying” as an absolute “freedom” from the structuring of our subjective experience by culture, which becomes apparent in mimetic efforts. In turn, lying is thus an assertion of individuality.</tei-p>

				<tei-p data-origname="p">142. As Schroeder reports: “The 'solid stolid British intellect' seems to have been a popular cliché in late Victorian times. In his Essays on Poetry and Poets, a collection which Wilde reviewed in Dec. 1886 , Roden Noel (1834-94), for example, speaks of 'the stolid, practical, but rather obtuse English mind.' And for Lady Wilde, not surprisingly, stolidness seems to have been likewise the dominant English character trait, if we can believe the Athenaeum reviewer of her volume on Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages of Ireland who took great pains to quote all the passages where the word 'stolid' occurred and who cried out at the end in protest” (58).</tei-p>

As Josephine Guy writes, “The idea that late Greak art received forms and techniques from an earlier period had been suggested by Walte Pater in his essay ‘The Beginnings of Greek Sculpture’. . .Pater argued that the work of Phidias expressed certain qualities anticipated in the work of Homer” (409).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Schroeder notes, Wilde’s assertion here was re-articulated in his “review 'Mr William Morris's Last Book' (March 1889): 'From an artistic point of view it [Morris's Tale of the House of the Wolfings] may be described as an attempt to return by a self-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age. Attempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art. From some such feeling came the Pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day and the archaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.'” (59).</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">Guy also notes that “Wilde is referring to the influence of the original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, founded in 1848, on a later generation of artists and poets, such as Burne-Jones, Swinburne, William Morris, and of course Wilde himself” (410).</tei-p>

				<tei-p data-origname="p">149. This final sentence suggests that, for Wilde, to mimic is to be behind, to lie is to create, and to influence culture through the creation of art is to augment the cultural frameworks which structure our future perceptions and encounters with the world. And in this way, art becomes anticipatory of life and provides “form” for the “expression of Life,” as signaled in the paragraph below and expanded upon in the below addition, beginning with “it follows,” to the 1891 edition. See also Wilde’s differentiation between the redeemable “lying for its own sake” and other forms of non-artistic/creative lying.</tei-p>

Vivian's 'final revelation' served as the climax in Punch's little rhymed satire 'In Defence of the Great Paradoxist' (May 1892): 'He may not be "earnest," he may not be "smart," / You may say, if you please, he's unable to sing; / But, oh, you must own he's a "work of art," - / A "beautiful untrue thing!"'”</tei-p>
				<tei-p data-origname="p">151. Allusions to Tennyson’s The Prncess and William Blake’s “To the Evening Star.” And, as Schroeder observes, “The two quotations recall Swinburne's essay on Blake (1866) - the essay, it will be remembered, gave Wilde the title for 'Pen, Pencil and Poison' in which Swinburne singled out the line from Blake's ode 'To the Evening Star' for particular praise and put it side by side with the poetry of Tennyson” (59).</tei-p>
