If<lb/> he did, he would<milestone n="intentions_38"/> cease to be an artist. Take<lb/> an example from our own day. <lb/> I know that you are fond of Japanese<lb/> things. Now, do you really imagine that the<lb/> Japanese people, as they are presented to us in <lb/>art, have any existence? If you do,<lb/> you have never understood Japanese art at all. <lb/>The Japanese people are the deliberate self-conscious creation <lb/>of certain individual artists. . If you set a picture by<lb/> Hokusia, or Hokkei, or any of the great<lb/> native painters, beside a real Japanese<lb/> gentleman or lady,<lb/> you will see that <lb/>there is not the slightest resemblance between<lb/> them. The actual people who live in Japan<lb/> are not unlike the general run of English<lb/> people; that is to say, they are extremely commonplace,<lb/> andhave nothing curious or extraordinary about<lb/> them. In fact, the whole of Japan is a pure<lb/> invention. There is no such country, there are<lb/> no such people. One of our most charming<lb/> painters went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the foolish hope<lb/> of seeing the Japanese. All he saw, all he<lb/> had the chance of painting, were a few lanterns<lb/> and some fans. He was quite unable to discover the<lb/> inhabitants, as his <lb/>delightful exhibition at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well. He did<lb/> not know that the Japanese people are, as I <lb/>have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite <lb/>fancy of art. <lb/>And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, <lb/>you will not behave like a tourist and go to Tokio.<lb/> On the contrary, you will stay at home, and steep <lb/>yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists,<lb/> and then, when you have absorbed the spirit of<lb/> their style, and caught their imaginative manner<lb/> of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in the<lb/> Park, or stroll down Piccadilly, and <milestone n="intentions_39"/>if you cannot <lb/>see an absolutely Japanese effect there, you <lb/>will not see it anywhere.</p>
