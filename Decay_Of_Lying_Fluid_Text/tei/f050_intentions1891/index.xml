But<lb/> in the English Church a man succeeds, <lb/>not through his capacity for<lb/> belief, but through his capacity for<lb/> disbelief. Ours is the only Church where <lb/>the sceptic stands at the altar, and <lb/>where St. Thomas is regarded as the <lb/>ideal apostle. Many a worthy clergyman, <lb/>who passes his life in admirable works <lb/>of kindly charity, lives and dies <lb/>unnoticed and unknown; but it is sufficient <lb/>for some shallow uneducated passman <lb/>out of either University to get up in <lb/>his pulpit and express his doubts <lb/>about Noah's ark, or Balaam's ass, or <lb/>Jonah and the whale, for half of <lb/>London to flock to hear him, and to<lb/> sit open-mouthed in rapt admiration<lb/> at his superb<milestone n="intentions_41"/> intellect.
